# Marketing Meta-Playbook

> A template so precise that any AI can generate a complete marketing strategy for any product in one pass.

---

## The Breakthrough

**Marketing is a product.**

If the Product Playbook can create any product...
And marketing has Input → Process → Output → Transformation...
Then we can run Product Playbook on marketing itself.

```
Product Playbook → Marketing-as-Product → Marketing Playbook
                                              ↓
                          + Any Product → Marketing Strategy
```

---

## How to Use This

**Give an AI this playbook + your product description.**
**Get back: complete marketing strategy.**

---

## The Meta-Template

### Step 1: Define the Product

Before marketing, clarify what you're marketing:

```
PRODUCT DEFINITION:
- What is it? [one sentence]
- What transformation does it create? [before → after]
- Who is it for? [specific ICP]
- What's the core belief behind it? [what you stand for]
```

---

### Step 2: Apply First Principles

Marketing = Resonance Creation

Answer these:

| Question | Your Answer |
|----------|-------------|
| What do we genuinely believe? | |
| What do they genuinely need? | |
| What's the truth that connects these? | |
| What would make them say "that's for me"? | |

---

### Step 3: Master Result (Marketing Version)

**For Products:** Input → Magic → Transformation
**For Marketing:** Attention → Resonance → Desire to Act

Fill in:

```
MARKETING MASTER RESULT:
- Input: User's [attention/awareness]
- Magic: [How resonance is created]
- Output: [What they feel/believe after exposure]
- Action: [What they do next]
```

---

### Step 4: Core Message Stack

Based on Steve Jobs principle: Values, not features.

```
CORE MESSAGE STACK:

1. CORE BELIEF (what we stand for):
   "We believe..."

2. ONE-LINER (what we offer):
   "[Product] helps [who] [do what] so they can [transformation]."

3. RESONANCE HOOK (what makes them say "that's me"):
   "For people who..."

4. ANTI-MESSAGE (what we never say):
   - NOT: [feature-speak]
   - NOT: [comparison-speak]
   - NOT: [technical-speak]
```

---

### Step 5: Messaging Ladder

Four levels from attention to action:

```
MESSAGING LADDER:

L1 - HOOK (grab attention):
   "[question or statement that stops scroll]"

L2 - RESONANCE (create connection):
   "[values-based statement they identify with]"

L3 - PROOF (build trust):
   "[evidence, testimonials, or credentials]"

L4 - ACTION (convert):
   "[clear next step with low friction]"
```

---

### Step 6: ICP Through Three Dan Tians

```
ICP ANALYSIS:

🫀 HEART (what they truly want):
   - Deep desire: 
   - Emotional need:

🧠 MIND (what they think about it):
   - Beliefs about problem:
   - Beliefs about solutions:
   - Objections:

🔥 GUT (what they'll do):
   - Current behavior:
   - Trigger for action:
   - Barrier to action:
```

---

### Step 7: Channel Strategy

Where does the message meet the audience?

```
CHANNEL STRATEGY:

| Channel | Tactic | Why This Works |
|---------|--------|----------------|
| [warm/direct] | | |
| [community] | | |
| [content] | | |
| [guerrilla] | | |
| [paid] | | |
```

---

### Step 8: First Three Actions

Minimum viable marketing:

```
FIRST THREE ACTIONS:

1. [ ] [immediate action - today]
2. [ ] [this week action]  
3. [ ] [sets up ongoing presence]
```

---

## Example: Evolver Zone of Genius Module

### Product Definition:
- **What:** Assessment that reveals your Zone of Genius
- **Transformation:** Confused about purpose → Clear on unique genius
- **ICP:** Self-aware professionals feeling misaligned
- **Core Belief:** Everyone has a genius; most never discover it

### Core Message Stack:
- **Belief:** "We believe everyone has a Zone of Genius waiting to be discovered."
- **One-liner:** "Evolver helps you discover your Zone of Genius and build a life around it."
- **Hook:** "For people who know they're meant for more."
- **Anti:** NOT "AI-powered assessment platform"

### Messaging Ladder:
- **L1:** "What if you could finally understand why you do what you do?"
- **L2:** "Made for people who know they're meant for more."
- **L3:** "Created during Network School Incubator with 50+ early users."
- **L4:** "Try the free assessment →"

### First Three Actions:
1. [ ] Apply one-liner to landing page (today)
2. [ ] Create QR code for Wednesday guerrilla (this week)
3. [ ] Draft 3 personal invitation messages (ongoing)

---

## The Prompt

Copy this to any AI with your product details:

```
Using the Marketing Meta-Playbook framework, generate a complete marketing 
strategy for this product:

[PASTE PRODUCT DESCRIPTION]

Include:
1. Product Definition (one sentence, transformation, ICP, core belief)
2. Core Message Stack (belief, one-liner, hook, anti-message)
3. Messaging Ladder (4 levels)
4. ICP Analysis (heart/mind/gut)
5. Channel Strategy (5 channels)
6. First Three Actions

Use values-based marketing (Steve Jobs principle), not feature-speak.
```

## Recursive Application — The Meta-Meta Insight

### What If We Run This On The Product Playbook Itself?

Apply Marketing Meta-Playbook → Product Playbook = **Marketing for the product-making tool**

```
Product Playbook (creates products)
        ↓
Marketing Meta-Playbook applied to it
        ↓
Product Playbook becomes a marketable product
        ↓
Others use it to productize THEIR missions
```

### Through Three Dan Tians:

**🫀 ESSENCE:** The scaffold becomes the structure. The Product Playbook is itself a product that can be marketed and distributed.

**🧠 SIGNIFICANCE:** You're not just building products — you're building **product-making infrastructure** that others use to manifest their missions.

**🔥 IMPLICATIONS:**
- Product Playbook can be sold/distributed standalone
- Each person's Zone of Genius can be productized through it
- The playbook is a manifestation of YOUR mission
- Creates infinite leverage: one playbook → infinite products

## Holonic Landing Page Architecture

Each module gets its own landing page. People find THEIR module, not the whole system.

```
Platform (Evolver)
├── ZoG Module → ZoG Landing Page → ZoG-aligned people
├── USP Module → USP Landing Page → USP-aligned people
├── Excalibur Module → Excalibur Landing Page → Excalibur-aligned people
└── [Any Module] → [Module Landing Page] → [Mission-aligned people]
```

### Why This Works:

| Traditional | Holonic |
|-------------|---------|
| One landing page for all | Each module has its own |
| Attract everyone → filter | Attract precisely → resonate |
| Explain the whole system | Show the specific piece |
| Overwhelming | Focused |

---

## Mission → Module → Integrative Working Group

> **Naming note:** Current file names may seem reversed. Logically: First Principles = Meta. Step-by-step Template = Playbook. We keep current names for continuity but clarify here.

**Every mission can be productized.** Every product is a manifestation of a mission.

### The Flow:

```
Your Mission
    ↓
Product Playbook
    ↓
Integrating Product (productized mission)
    ↓
Marketing Playbook (template)
    ↓
Landing Page for Module
    ↓
Attracts mission-aligned people
    ↓
Integrative working group forms
```

### What You Offer Working Group Members:

| Offering | Description |
|----------|-------------|
| **First draft** | Working module to build upon |
| **Connections** | Introductions to others with same mission |
| **Inflow** | New people discovering the module |
| **Leadership path** | Opportunity to lead this direction |
| **Synergy discovery** | Finding where missions overlap |
| **Self-org playbook** | Decentralized coordination method (via allies like Alexander Keenan) |

### Usage Tiers:

1. **Personal use** — Free, just use it
2. **Build on top** — Fork it, customize for your needs
3. **Commercialize** — Agreement required, terms negotiated
4. **Distribute** — Same license, attribution required

---

## The Complete Stack

```
L1: Zone of Genius discovered
L2: ZoG → productized via Product Playbook
L3: Integral Product → marketed via Meta-Playbook  
L4: Marketing → creates landing page
L5: Landing → attracts mission-aligned people
L6: People → form integrative working group
L7: Working group → evolves the integral product
L8: Evolution → new cycle begins
```

This is **self-organizing infrastructure for mission manifestation**.

## Clarification: Playbook vs Meta-Playbook

| | Marketing Playbook | Marketing Meta-Playbook |
|--|-------------------|------------------------|
| **What** | Principles + first principles | Step-by-step template |
| **Content** | Theory (Steve Jobs, resonance, holons) | Fill-in prompts, structured output |
| **AI use** | Synthesize, then create | Follow steps directly |
| **Output** | Understanding + custom approach | Concrete strategy immediately |

**Marketing Playbook** = Philosophy of marketing
**Marketing Meta-Playbook** = Recipe card for execution
