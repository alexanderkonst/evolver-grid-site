## The Breakthrough

**Marketing is a product.**

If the Product Playbook can create any product...
And marketing has Input → Process → Output → Transformation...
Then we can run Product Playbook on marketing itself.

```
Product Playbook → Marketing-as-Product → Marketing Playbook
                                              ↓
                          + Any Product → Marketing Strategy
```

## How to Use This

**Give an AI this playbook + your product description.**
**Get back: complete marketing strategy.**

---

## The Meta-Template

### Step 1: Define the Product

Before marketing, clarify what you're marketing:

```
PRODUCT DEFINITION:
- What is it? [one sentence]
- What transformation does it create? [before → after]
- Who is it for? [specific ICP]
- What's the core belief behind it? [what you stand for]
```

---

### Step 2: Apply First Principles

Marketing = Resonance Creation

Answer these:

| Question | Your Answer |
|----------|-------------|
| What do we genuinely believe? | |
| What do they genuinely need? | |
| What's the truth that connects these? | |
| What would make them say "that's for me"? | |

---

### Step 3: Master Result (Marketing Version)

**For Products:** Input → Magic → Transformation
**For Marketing:** Attention → Resonance → Desire to Act

Fill in:

```
MARKETING MASTER RESULT:
- Input: User's [attention/awareness]
- Magic: [How resonance is created]
- Output: [What they feel/believe after exposure]
- Action: [What they do next]
```

---

### Step 4: Core Message Stack

Based on Steve Jobs principle: Values, not features.

```
CORE MESSAGE STACK:

1. CORE BELIEF (what we stand for):
   "We believe..."

2. ONE-LINER (what we offer):
   "[Product] helps [who] [do what] so they can [transformation]."

3. RESONANCE HOOK (what makes them say "that's me"):
   "For people who..."

4. ANTI-MESSAGE (what we never say):
   - NOT: [feature-speak]
   - NOT: [comparison-speak]
   - NOT: [technical-speak]
```

---

### Step 5: Messaging Ladder

Four levels from attention to action:

```
MESSAGING LADDER:

L1 - HOOK (grab attention):
   "[question or statement that stops scroll]"

L2 - RESONANCE (create connection):
   "[values-based statement they identify with]"

L3 - PROOF (build trust):
   "[evidence, testimonials, or credentials]"

L4 - ACTION (convert):
   "[clear next step with low friction]"
```

---

### Step 6: ICP Through Three Dan Tians

```
ICP ANALYSIS:

🫀 HEART (what they truly want):
   - Deep desire: 
   - Emotional need:

🧠 MIND (what they think about it):
   - Beliefs about problem:
   - Beliefs about solutions:
   - Objections:

🔥 GUT (what they'll do):
   - Current behavior:
   - Trigger for action:
   - Barrier to action:
```

---

### Step 7: Channel Strategy

Where does the message meet the audience?

```
CHANNEL STRATEGY:

| Channel | Tactic | Why This Works |
|---------|--------|----------------|
| [warm/direct] | | |
| [community] | | |
| [content] | | |
| [guerrilla] | | |
| [paid] | | |
```

---

### Step 8: First Three Actions

Minimum viable marketing:

```
FIRST THREE ACTIONS:

1. [ ] [immediate action - today]
2. [ ] [this week action]  
3. [ ] [sets up ongoing presence]
```

---

## Example: Evolver Zone of Genius Module

### Product Definition:
- **What:** Assessment that reveals your Zone of Genius
- **Transformation:** Confused about purpose → Clear on unique genius
- **ICP:** Self-aware professionals feeling misaligned
- **Core Belief:** Everyone has a genius; most never discover it

### Core Message Stack:
- **Belief:** "We believe everyone has a Zone of Genius waiting to be discovered."
- **One-liner:** "Evolver helps you discover your Zone of Genius and build a life around it."
- **Hook:** "For people who know they're meant for more."
- **Anti:** NOT "AI-powered assessment platform"

### Messaging Ladder:
- **L1:** "What if you could finally understand why you do what you do?"
- **L2:** "Made for people who know they're meant for more."
- **L3:** "Created during Network School Incubator with 50+ early users."
- **L4:** "Try the free assessment →"

### First Three Actions:
1. [ ] Apply one-liner to landing page (today)
2. [ ] Create QR code for Wednesday guerrilla (this week)
3. [ ] Draft 3 personal invitation messages (ongoing)
