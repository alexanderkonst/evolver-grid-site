## Architecture Insight

**Genius vector is richest** because:
- It's the economic engine
- Most actionable for real-world results
- Leads to monetization

**Other vectors are practice/learning heavy**:
- Spirit → Practices (presence, breathwork)
- Mind → Learning (integral theory)
- Emotions → Practices (release work)
- Body → Practices (physical)

**This is okay.** Genius is the entry point for most users (economic motivation). Other vectors support well-being.
