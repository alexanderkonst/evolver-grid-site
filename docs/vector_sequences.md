## Structure Per Vector

Each vector has a **growth sequence** — a recommended order of actions that take a person from beginner to master.

**Action types available:**
- 📚 Microlearning (2-5 min educational content)
- 🧘 Practice (transformational activity from Library)
- 📝 Profile Step (self-assessment, data capture)
- ⚡ Life Action (real-world task)
- 💰 Monetization Step (for Genius Monetization loop)
- 🤝 Connection (social/collaborative action)

## How System Uses This

1. Player completes action → mark complete in database
2. System looks at player's progress in each vector
3. For "My Next Move": 
   - Find lowest QoL domain
   - Map to primary vector
   - Find next incomplete action in that vector's sequence
   - Recommend it

- **Microlearning** links to content modules (to be created)
- **Life Actions** are tracked via self-report
- **Monetization Steps** link to paid modules when appropriate
