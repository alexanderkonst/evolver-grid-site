> What to build first for Week 2

*Draft: 2025-01-07*

---

## MVP Goal

**Testable by Jan 18:** A user can complete onboarding and take their first 3 actions.

---

## Must-Have (Week 2)

| Module | What It Does | Exists? |
|--------|--------------|---------|
| **ZoG Flow** | AI check → Talent assessment → Genius reveal | ✅ Exists, needs polish |
| **QoL Assessment** | 8 domains → Life snapshot → Opportunity | ✅ Exists, needs polish |
| **Daily Loop v2** | Me / My Life / My Next Move layout | 🟡 Behind feature flag |
| **First Actions** | 3-5 ultra-easy actions (1-3 min each) | ❌ Need to create |
| **XP + Streak** | Award XP, track streak | ✅ Exists |

---

## First Actions Library (Critical)

These are the "1% better" starting actions:

| Action | Duration | Growth Path | Type |
|--------|----------|-------------|------|
| Conscious Breath | 1 min | Spirit | 🔥 Activation |
| Reread Genius Profile | 2 min | Genius | 📝 Reflection |
| Name 3 Emotions | 2 min | Emotions | 📝 Self-check |
| Body Scan | 3 min | Body | 🔥 Activation |
| One Insight from Micro | 3 min | Mind | 📚 Micro-learning |

*Each should feel like a win, not a task.*

---

## Nice-to-Have (Week 3+)

| Module | Notes |
|--------|-------|
| **Micro-learning player** | Video infographic with 90s limit |
| **Growth Paths UI** | Visual skill trees |
| **Matchmaking** | Genius matching |
| **Marketplace** | Offers |

---

## Build Sequence

1. **Polish ZoG + QoL** — ensure reveal moments work
2. **First Actions library** — 5 actions ready
3. **Daily Loop v2 activation** — flip feature flag
4. **Test with 5 users** — internal feedback

---

## Dependencies

- Growth Paths content (Spirit/Mind done, Emotions/Body in progress)
- Codex refactor Phase 2 (action pipeline)
