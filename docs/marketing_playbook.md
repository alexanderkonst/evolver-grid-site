# Part I: Philosophy — What Marketing IS

## The Steve Jobs Principle

**Marketing is NOT:**
- Features, specs, technical details
- "Why we're better than competitors"
- Logical arguments about product quality

**Marketing IS:**
- Communicating who you are
- What you stand for
- Values and beliefs

## Through Three Lenses

### 🫀 ESSENCE / HEART — What Marketing Essentially IS

> **Marketing = Resonance Creation**

At its core: creating resonance between your truth (what you genuinely offer) and their truth (what they genuinely need).

| Brand | The Resonance |
|-------|---------------|
| Nike | "We honor greatness" ↔ "I want to be great" |
| Got Milk? | "You miss it when it's gone" ↔ "I take good things for granted" |
| Apple | "Crazy ones change the world" ↔ "I believe I can change things" |

**One sentence:** *Marketing is helping people recognize that what you offer is what they already want.*

---

### 🧠 SIGNIFICANCE / MIND — What Marketing Truly Means

Without marketing, even the greatest transformation remains unknown.

**For a creator:**
- Your genius stays hidden
- Your impact stays local
- Your transformation stays untransmitted

**The deeper meaning:**
> Marketing is how value finds its rightful recipients.

---

### 🔥 IMPLICATIONS / GUT — What Consequences It Creates

**If you get marketing right:**
- Right people find you
- Wrong people filter themselves out
- Your message compounds over time
- Tribe forms around values

**If you get marketing wrong:**
- Attract wrong fit (bad clients, draining relationships)
- Constant explanation needed
- No resonance → no organic growth

**The ripple effect:**
```
Clear Values → Right Resonance → Right People → Right Feedback → Better Product → Stronger Values → ...
```

# Part II: Recipe — Step-by-Step Template

> Give an AI this playbook + your product description → Get back: complete marketing strategy.

---

## Step 1: Define the Product

```
PRODUCT DEFINITION:
- What is it? [one sentence]
- What transformation does it create? [before → after]
- Who is it for? [specific ICP]
- What's the core belief behind it? [what you stand for]
```

---

## Step 2: Apply First Principles

| Question | Your Answer |
|----------|-------------|
| What do we genuinely believe? | |
| What do they genuinely need? | |
| What's the truth that connects these? | |
| What would make them say "that's for me"? | |

---

## Step 3: Master Result (Marketing Version)

```
MARKETING MASTER RESULT:
- Input: User's [attention/awareness]
- Magic: [How resonance is created]
- Output: [What they feel/believe after exposure]
- Action: [What they do next]
```

---

## Step 4: Core Message Stack

```
1. CORE BELIEF (what we stand for):
   "We believe..."

2. ONE-LINER (what we offer):
   "[Product] helps [who] [do what] so they can [transformation]."

3. RESONANCE HOOK (what makes them say "that's me"):
   "For people who..."

4. ANTI-MESSAGE (what we never say):
   - NOT: [feature-speak]
   - NOT: [comparison-speak]
   - NOT: [technical-speak]
```

---

## Step 5: Messaging Ladder

```
L1 - HOOK (grab attention):
   "[question or statement that stops scroll]"

L2 - RESONANCE (create connection):
   "[values-based statement they identify with]"

L3 - PROOF (build trust):
   "[evidence, testimonials, or credentials]"

L4 - ACTION (convert):
   "[clear next step with low friction]"
```

---

## Step 6: ICP Through Three Dan Tians

> 📎 For deeper pain analysis, see `pain_theory_playbook.md` (Decision Pressure, Felt Consequences, Cost of Inaction, Stakes)

```
🫀 HEART (what they truly want):
   - Deep desire: 
   - Emotional need:
   - Pain Point A (where they are now):

🧠 MIND (what they think about it):
   - Beliefs about problem:
   - Beliefs about solutions:
   - Objections:
   - Awareness Stage (1-5): [Unaware → Solution-Aware]

🔥 GUT (what they'll do):
   - Current behavior:
   - Trigger for action:
   - Barrier to action:
   - Decision Pressure: [Low/Medium/High]
```

---

## Step 7: Channel Strategy

| Channel | Tactic | Why This Works |
|---------|--------|----------------|
| **Warm/Direct** | Personal invites, DMs | Highest trust, fastest feedback |
| **Community** | Pilot groups, shared spaces | Built-in audience, social proof |
| **Content** | Playlists, videos, posts | Evergreen, compounds over time |
| **Guerrilla** | QR codes, coworking presence, stickers | Low cost, high curiosity, ICP-matched |
| **Paid** | Targeted ads (if budget) | Scale after organic validation |

**Guerrilla Quick Reference:**
- Coworking days = work + leads same day
- Laptop stickers = passive attention
- Café QR codes = low cost, high curiosity
- Playlist lead magnet = value first, identity second

---

## Step 8: First Three Actions

```
1. [ ] [immediate action - today]
2. [ ] [this week action]  
3. [ ] [sets up ongoing presence]
```

# Part III: Examples & Architecture

## Example: Evolver Zone of Genius

**Product Definition:**
- **What:** Assessment that reveals your Zone of Genius
- **Transformation:** Confused about purpose → Clear on unique genius
- **ICP:** Self-aware professionals feeling misaligned
- **Core Belief:** Everyone has a genius; most never discover it

**Core Message Stack:**
- **Belief:** "We believe everyone has a Zone of Genius waiting to be discovered."
- **One-liner:** "Evolver helps you discover your Zone of Genius and build a life around it."
- **Hook:** "For people who know they're meant for more."
- **Anti:** NOT "AI-powered assessment platform"

**Messaging Ladder:**
- **L1:** "What if you could finally understand why you do what you do?"
- **L2:** "Made for people who know they're meant for more."
- **L3:** "Created during Network School Incubator with 50+ early users."
- **L4:** "Try the free assessment →"

## Holonic Landing Page Architecture

Each module gets its own landing page. People find THEIR module, not the whole system.

├── ZoG Module → ZoG Landing Page → ZoG-aligned people
├── Excalibur Module → Excalibur Landing Page → Business builders
├── [Any Module] → [Module Landing Page] → [Mission-aligned people]
```

| Traditional | Holonic |
|-------------|---------|
| One landing page for all | Each module has its own |
| Attract everyone → filter | Attract precisely → resonate |
| Explain the whole system | Show the specific piece |

# Part IV: The AI Prompt

Copy this to any AI with your product details:

# Part V: The Recursive Insight

**Marketing is a product.**

If the Product Playbook can create any product... and marketing has Input → Process → Output → Transformation... then you can run Product Playbook on marketing itself.

### The Complete Stack:

```
L1: Zone of Genius discovered
L2: ZoG → productized via Product Playbook
L3: Product → marketed via Marketing Playbook  
L4: Marketing → creates landing page
L5: Landing → attracts mission-aligned people
L6: People → form integrative working group
L7: Working group → evolves the product
L8: Evolution → new cycle begins
```

This is **self-organizing infrastructure for mission manifestation**.
