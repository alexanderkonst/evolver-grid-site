**Started:** 2026-02-10 16:30
**Status:** ✅ ALL PHASES COMPLETE
**Spec:** [equilibrium_product_spec.md](./equilibrium_product_spec.md)

---

## INPUT ✅ COMPLETE (5/5)

- [x] 1. **ICP:** Founders, creators, knowledge workers doing daily deep work. Primary: Alexander himself.
- [x] 2. **Transformation:** Arbitrary willpower-driven work → Harmonious cycle-aware deep work
- [x] 3. **Pain:** "4 hours later I look up exhausted", "Pomodoro feels arbitrary", "disconnected from natural rhythm"
- [x] 4. **Dream Outcome:** "Work flows naturally", "3 sprints > 8 hours unfocused", "energy consistent, no crashes"
- [x] 5. **Action:** Open Equilibrium, breathe with circle, work sprints with guided transitions

---

## PHASE 1: PRODUCT ✅ COMPLETE (7/7)

- [x] 1.1 **Master Result** — "Equilibrium takes founders from arbitrary, willpower-driven work into harmonious, cycle-aware deep work."
- [x] 1.2 **Sub-Results (5):**
  1. Coherent Breathing (breath calm, HRV synced)
  2. Work Sprint Awareness (see 96-min structure)
  3. Guided Transitions (no willpower needed for pauses)
  4. Day Awareness (which sprint, AM/PM position)
  5. Cycle Awareness (week, month, quarter, planetary)
- [x] 1.3 **Screens (4 layers, not pages):**
  1. Breathing Circle — central, always visible, 5.5s/5.5s
  2. Sprint View — 4 pulse arcs, phase highlight, transition prompts
  3. Day View — sprints completed/remaining, AM/PM energy
  4. Cycle Rings — week, month, quarter, planetary hour, moon
- [x] 1.4 **Screen Details (Dan Tians):**
  - Breathing Circle: 🫀 calm + present | 🧠 coherent breathing | 🔥 circle IS the interaction
  - Sprint View: 🫀 safe to focus | 🧠 pulse 2, focus phase, 8 min | 🔥 transition prompts
  - Day View: 🫀 on track | 🧠 sprint 2 of 3 | 🔥 tap to expand
  - Cycle Rings: 🫀 connected to larger | 🧠 week 2, Q1 | 🔥 tap ring for details
- [x] 1.5 **Extensions:**
  - Artifacts: sprint log, daily rhythm data
  - Emotions: calm → purposeful → confident → connected
  - Completion: continuous tool, no "done" — success = daily use
  - Skip: transition prompts ignorable, outer rings hideable
  - Bridges: standalone v1, future Evolver integration
- [x] 1.6 **Wireframes:** ASCII concentric rings layout with status bar
- [x] 🔥 **ROAST GATE 1 — PASS** (Alexander: "LGTM")

## PHASE 2: ARCHITECTURE ✅ COMPLETE (6/6)

- [x] 2.1 **Module Boundaries:**
  - Entry: URL in browser (iPad Safari, desktop Chrome)
  - Exit: close tab (no exit flow)
  - Data in: `Date.now()`, localStorage preferences
  - Data out: sprint logs in localStorage, no server
  - Auth: none
  - Decision: **standalone app**, not inside Evolver Platform
- [x] 2.2 **Routing:**
  - `/` → The Clock (everything)
  - `/settings` → modal overlay (optional)
  - No guards, no auth, no redirects
  - Tech: Vite + TypeScript, Vanilla CSS, pure DOM + SVG/Canvas
- [x] 2.3 **Data Schema:**
  - No database — all localStorage
  - `preferences` (breath duration, sprint duration, toggles)
  - `sprintLog` (date, number, start/end time, completed)
  - `activeSprint` (startTime, currentPulse, currentPhase, paused)
- [x] 2.4 **Shell & Layout:**
  - No nav, no header, no footer — fullscreen clock
  - Always focus mode
  - Responsive: iPad landscape (primary), portrait, desktop, phone
  - No scroll — everything fits viewport
- [x] 2.5 **State Management:**
  - Preferences → localStorage (survives reboot)
  - Active sprint → localStorage (survives refresh)
  - Sprint log → localStorage (indefinite)
  - Cycle positions → **computed from `Date.now()`** (no storage)
  - Resume logic: if sprint exists and not expired, resume
- [x] 🔥 **ROAST GATE 2 — PASS** (Alexander: auto-proceed)

## PHASE 3: UI ✅ COMPLETE (6/6)

- [x] 3.1 **Visual Rules:** 17 color tokens, 3 font families, 6-step spacing, glow-only shadows
- [x] 3.2 **Building Blocks:** Breathing circle, Ring Arc, Phase Label, Transition Prompt, Status Bar, Sprint CTA, Settings
- [x] 3.3 **Layout Templates:** 4 responsive breakpoints (phone→iPad→desktop)
- [x] 3.4 **Brandbook Integration:** Bio-Light dark variant, 8s Anti-Anxiety Motion, Serif/Sans split
- [x] 3.5 **Micro-interactions:** Breathing scale, phase transitions, sprint start/end, ring hover, prompt fade
- [x] 🔥 **ROAST GATE 3 — PASS**

---

## PHASE 4: CODE ✅ COMPLETE (6/6)

- [x] 4.1 **Create Files:** `index.html`, `src/style.css`, `src/cycles.ts`, `src/clock.ts`, `src/main.ts`, `src/guidance.ts`
- [x] 4.2 **Implement Screens:** Ambient (breathing + rings + CTA), Sprint (phases + countdown + prompts), Settings (breath, wake/sleep, toggles)
- [x] 4.3 **Connect Routes:** Single `/` route, settings overlay, `/equilibrium` in main Evolver app
- [x] 4.4 **Connect Data:** localStorage (preferences with wake/sleep, sprint state, sprint log), cycles from `Date.now()`, Energetic Week Blueprint
- [x] 4.5 **Verification:** TypeScript 0 errors on both apps, browser tests passed
- [x] 🔥 **ROAST GATE 4 — PASS**
