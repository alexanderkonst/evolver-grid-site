## Week 1: Sunday — The Sun

Sunday is named for the Sun — the center that everything orbits. Ancient cultures rested and worshipped on this day because the sun's energy is about seeing clearly, not doing. Modern culture lost this: we dread Monday instead of using Sunday to envision. The pattern works because vision requires stepping back from action. You can't see the whole board while you're moving a piece.

## Week 2: Monday — The Moon

Monday is the Moon's day. The Moon reflects light — it doesn't generate it. That's why Mondays feel like "not a good day to start hard things." You're right to feel that way. The Moon's intelligence is receptive, not active. Use Monday to sense what needs attention, not to force output. Your emotional navigation system is loudest today — listen to it instead of overriding it.

## Week 3: Tuesday — Mars

Tuesday belongs to Mars — Tiw's day in English, Mardi in French, Martes in Spanish. Mars is the planet of physical action and courage. Your body has more available willpower on Tuesdays than you think. The ancient pattern: warriors trained on Mars-day. The modern version: do the hard, physical, or confrontational thing today. Your body will back you up.

## Week 4: Wednesday — Mercury

Wednesday is Mercury's day — Mercredi in French, Miércoles in Spanish. Mercury is the messenger: communication, writing, mental speed. Your linguistic and logical mind is sharpest mid-week because you've had two days of context-loading. This isn't mystical — your working memory is genuinely most loaded by Wednesday, making connections faster and words more precise.

## Week 5: Thursday — Jupiter

Thursday is Jupiter's day — Thor's day in English, Jeudi in French. Jupiter is the largest planet: expansion, perspective, abundance. By Thursday you've built enough momentum to see the bigger picture. Strategic conversations, teaching, and big-picture thinking land here because you have four days of context and still have energy to act on what you see.

## Week 6: Friday — Venus

Friday is Venus-day — Vendredi in French, Viernes in Spanish. Venus governs beauty, pleasure, and connection. Friday became the social day worldwide not by accident — after four days of output, the human system craves aesthetic and relational input. Design work, creative exploration, and relationship-building are genuinely better on Fridays because you're ready to receive, not push.

## Week 7: Saturday — Saturn

Saturday is Saturn's day — the planet of discipline, structure, and time itself. Saturn is the boundary-setter: what stays, what goes. The impulse to "organize" or "clean up" on Saturday is ancient wisdom your body remembers. Use it. Review systems, prune commitments, file things properly. Structure created on Saturn-day lasts because you're not distracted by the week's demands.

## Week 8: New Moon

The New Moon is invisible — the sky is completely dark. Every culture used this moment to set intentions because when you can't see, you can only feel what you want. New Moon intentions aren't goal-setting — they're direction-sensing. The darkest night tells you which light you're missing.

## Week 9: Waxing Crescent

The first sliver of moon appears. This is the "first step" phase. Whatever you named at the New Moon now takes its first tiny visible form. Don't judge it — a crescent isn't a failure to be full. It's proof that something started. First steps are supposed to be small.

## Week 10: First Quarter

The half moon. Half-lit, half-dark. This is where resistance appears — the thing you started meets reality. Every project, relationship, and habit hits friction here. The quarter moon teaches: friction is not failure. It's the material hardening. Push through, but don't force — let the resistance shape you.

## Week 11: Waxing Gibbous

Almost full but not yet. The gibbous phase is refinement — the 80% that needs the last 20%. Don't start over. Don't add new things. Polish what exists. This is the hardest phase for creative people because "almost done" feels worse than "just starting." Trust the process.

## Week 12: Full Moon

Maximum illumination. Everything is visible — including what you don't want to see. Full moons make people emotional because clarity is confrontational. Use it: look directly at reality. What is actually true right now? The full moon doesn't change anything — it just removes your ability to pretend you don't see what's there.

## Week 13: Waning Gibbous

The moon starts to shrink. This is the sharing phase — what you harvested at the full moon is meant to be given away. Teach, mentor, publish, distribute. Holding onto completed things during the waning phase creates psychic clutter that makes the next month harder. Pass it forward.

## Week 14: Last Quarter

Half-dark again, but the other half. The last quarter asks: what is done? Not "what should I abandon" — what is genuinely complete? Naming completions is harder than starting new things. But everything you carry forward that's actually finished weighs you down without adding value.

## Week 15: Waning Crescent

Almost dark. The thinnest sliver before total darkness. This is rest — real rest, not lazy rest. Your system is preparing for the next cycle. Fighting this phase is like staying awake out of stubbornness. Sleep. Dream. Be empty for a moment. Fullness always follows emptiness.
