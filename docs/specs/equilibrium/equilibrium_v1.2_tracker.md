## INPUT ✅ COMPLETE (5/5)

- [x] 1. **ICP:** Alexander + founders who do 2-4 deep work sprints/day, want rhythm not arbitrary timers
- [x] 2. **Transformation:** "No rhythm, push or drift" → "Glance → know exactly where I am → focus flows"
- [x] 3. **Pain:** "4 hours later I'm drained", "Pomodoro kills my flow", "I skip breaks then crash"
- [x] 4. **Dream Outcome:** "Glance → 8 min focus left → keep going with confidence", "3 sprints, energized not drained"
- [x] 5. **Action:** Open on iPad, breathe with circle, tap Enter Deep Focus, follow the rhythm

## PHASE 1: PRODUCT ✅ COMPLETE

- [x] 1.1 **Master Result** — "Equilibrium shows you exactly where you are in your work rhythm so you can focus without thinking about when to stop."
- [x] 🔥 ROAST 1.1 — All 9 checks pass. 12-year-old test ✅. Point B now includes specific "14 min left" moment.
- [x] 1.2 **Sub-Results (4):** Breathe & Center, See Your Sprint, Flow With Transitions, Know Your Day
  - **CUT from v1:** "Cycle Awareness" (week/month/quarter) demoted to extension — beautiful but doesn't help you focus
- [x] 🔥 ROAST 1.2 — All 9 checks pass. No duplicates, clear sequence, each is a felt win.
- [x] 1.3 **Screens (2 modes + 1 overlay):** Ambient Mode, Sprint Mode, Settings overlay
  - **CUT from v1:** "Day View" and "Cycle Rings" as separate screens — merged/demoted
- [x] 🔥 ROAST 1.3 — Clean. No screen does two things. Complete loop: Ambient → Sprint → Ambient.
- [x] 1.4 **Screen Details** — Dan Tians defined for all 3 screens. CTAs are result-oriented.
- [x] 🔥 ROAST 1.4 — Pass.
- [x] 1.5 **Extensions** — Sprint log, emotional states, completion criteria, skip paths, bridges. Outer cycle rings explicitly marked as "decorative context, not core."
- [x] 🔥 ROAST 1.5 — Pass.
- [x] 1.6 **Wireframes** — Ambient + Sprint ASCII wireframes. CTA centered. Minimal text.
- [x] 🔥 ROAST 1.6 — Pass.
- [x] 🔥 **ROAST GATE 1 — PASS** — Flow walkthrough complete. 3 roast cycles done. Key fix: information hierarchy clarified (sprint = core, outer rings = optional extension).

## PHASE 2: ARCHITECTURE ✅ COMPLETE (no changes needed)

- [x] 2.1 Module Boundaries — confirmed: standalone Vite app at `/equilibrium/`, no auth
- [x] 2.2 Routing — confirmed: one route, two modes, settings as modal overlay
- [x] 2.3 Data Schema — confirmed: all localStorage (preferences, active sprint, sprint log)
- [x] 2.4 Shell & Layout — confirmed: fullscreen, no nav/header/footer, responsive
- [x] 2.5 State Management — confirmed: preferences + sprint resume from localStorage, cycles computed from Date.now()
- [x] 🔥 ROAST GATE 2 — PASS. Nav walkthrough clean. No broken states. Pure data flow.

## PHASE 3: UI ✅ COMPLETE

- [x] 3.1 Visual Rules — Sprint ring prominence ↑, outer rings dim during sprint, text simplified to 3 lines max
- [x] 3.2 Building Blocks — All existing, no new components
- [x] 3.3 Layout Templates — No change, fullscreen centered
- [x] 3.4 Brandbook Integration — Calm + purposeful, Bio-Light dark, quiet voice
- [x] 3.5 Micro-interactions — Kept breathing + phase transitions. Added ring dim on sprint entry.
- [x] 🔥 ROAST GATE 3 — PASS. Fix list: (1) remove synthesis line ✅ (2) simplify text ✅ (3) fade outer rings ✅ (4) thicker sprint ring ✅ (5) add "Sprint X of Y" ✅

## PHASE 4: VIBE-CODING ✅ COMPLETE

- [x] 4.1 Files modified: `clock.ts`, `main.ts`, `guidance.ts`, `style.css`, `index.html`

- [x] 🔥 ROAST GATE 4 — PASS
