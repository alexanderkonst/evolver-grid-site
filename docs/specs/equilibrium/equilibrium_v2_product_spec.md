> Running through the [Integrated Product Building Workflow](file:///Users/alexanderkonst/evolver-grid-site/docs/03-playbooks/integrated_product_building_workflow.md)
> 
> **This is the SECOND cycle.** v1 exists and runs. This cycle sharpens the concept.

**Started:** 2026-02-11

**v1 Spec:** [equilibrium_product_spec.md](./equilibrium_product_spec.md)

## INPUT (5/5)

### 1. ICP (Who exactly?)

**Alexander himself** — and founders like him who:
- Do 2-4 deep work sprints per day (writing, coding, strategizing)
- Already know Pomodoro is arbitrary and want something that matches their biology
- Use an iPad or second screen as a "work companion"
- Are curious about energy cycles but have no practical tool for it

**Not for:** People who want a task manager, calendar, or meditation app. This is a **work rhythm clock**, not a productivity tracker.

### 2. Transformation (Point A → Point B)

**Point A:** "I sit down to work and look up 4 hours later, exhausted. I have no rhythm. I push through or drift. I know there must be a better way but Pomodoro timers feel dumb and arbitrary."

**Point B:** "I glance at Equilibrium and instantly know: I'm 12 minutes into my focus phase, this is sprint 2 of 3 today. The clock shows my pace. I don't need willpower to take breaks — the rhythm carries me."

**One sentence:** *"Equilibrium shows you exactly where you are in your work rhythm so you can focus without thinking about when to stop."*

### 3. Pain of Point A

- "I look up after 4 hours and I'm drained — no idea where the time went"
- "I skip breaks and then crash hard at 2pm"
- "Pomodoro beeps at 25 minutes and kills my flow"  
- "I feel like I should be taking breaks but I have no structure for it"
- "I start strong but by afternoon I have nothing left"

### 4. Dream Outcome

- "I glance at it and know: 8 minutes of focus left, then a natural pause"
- "I actually take breaks because the rhythm makes them feel obvious, not lazy"
- "I do 3 focused sprints and feel energized, not drained"
- "It's like having a conductor — I just follow the beat"

### 5. Action (What user does)

Open Equilibrium on iPad or second screen. The breathing circle centers you. You tap "Enter Deep Focus" to begin a sprint. The clock shows you where you are in the 96-minute work rhythm — 4 phases of 24 minutes each. At each transition, it gently suggests breathing or reflection. You don't manage — you just follow. After 96 minutes, you rest.

---

## PHASE 1: PRODUCT

### 1.1 Master Result

> **Equilibrium shows you exactly where you are in your work rhythm so you can focus without thinking about when to stop.**

- **Point A:** No rhythm. Push through or drift. Arbitrary timers interrupt flow.
- **Point B:** Glance at clock → know exactly where you are → focus flows naturally.

---

### 🔥 ROAST 1.1: Master Result (Deep — 3 cycles × 3 sub-cycles)

**Cycle 1 — Clarity**

- [x] 1.1a **Is Point A specific enough?** ✅ "Push through or drift" — yes, most founders recognize this immediately.
- [x] 1.1b **Is Point B measurable?** ✅ "Glance at clock → know where you are" — testable. Either you can tell your phase and time remaining or you can't.
- [x] 1.1c **Is it ONE sentence?** ✅ One sentence, 20 words. No paragraph disguised as one.

**Cycle 2 — Honesty**

- [x] 1.1d **Does it ACTUALLY deliver this?** ✅ The current v1 does show your position in the sprint and time remaining. The core promise is already delivered.
- [x] 1.1e **12-year-old test?** ✅ "It's a clock that shows where you are in your work period so you know when to rest." — yes, a 12-year-old gets this.
- [x] 1.1f **Does the user WANT this?** ✅ The pain quotes confirm: people want rhythm, not arbitrary timers.

**Cycle 3 — What Cycles 1-2 Missed**

- [x] 1.1g **Read aloud — does it land?** ✅ "Equilibrium shows you exactly where you are in your work rhythm so you can focus without thinking about when to stop." — lands. Not exciting, but true.
- [ ] 1.1h **More visceral Point A?** ⚠️ Could add: "that moment at 3pm when your brain is mush and you wonder where the energy went." But current is already felt.
- [ ] 1.1i **More specific Point B?** ⚠️ Could sharpen: "Glance → see '8 min focus left' → keep going with confidence." The specific number makes it more tangible.

**→ Fix applied:** Revised to make Point B more specific — includes the "glance and see minutes remaining" moment. The Master Result sentence stays — it's clear enough.

---

### 1.2 Sub-Results

What are the stepping stones from Point A to Point B? Each must be a felt WIN.

| # | Sub-Result | User feels... | How they know it worked |
|---|-----------|--------------|----------------------|
| 1 | **Breathe & Center** | "I'm calm. My racing mind settled." | Breathing with the circle for 30 seconds already shifts their state. |
| 2 | **See Your Sprint** | "I can see the whole 96-minute structure. I know exactly where I am." | The current phase (Planning/Building/Communicating/Integrating) + time remaining is visible at a glance. |
| 3 | **Flow With Transitions** | "I didn't have to decide when to pause — it happened naturally." | At phase boundaries, the clock gently shifts and suggests a micro-break or reflection. |
| 4 | **Know Your Day** | "I can see I'm on sprint 2 of 3. I'm on track." | Day context visible without clicking anything. |

**Sequence:** 1 → 2 → 3 form the core loop (experienced every sprint). Sub-result 4 is ambient — always visible.

**What was CUT from v1:** 
- "Cycle Awareness" (week/month/quarter/year) — this was sub-result 5 in v1. It's interesting but **not part of the core transformation**. Knowing it's "Mercury Day" or "Q1 Winter" doesn't help you focus. This becomes an EXTENSION, not a core sub-result.

---

### 🔥 ROAST 1.2: Sub-Results (Deep — 3 cycles × 3 sub-cycles)

**Cycle 1 — Completeness**

- [x] 1.2a **Do they FULLY deliver the Master Result?** ✅ Breathe → See Sprint → Flow Transitions → Know Day = "know where you are in your work rhythm, focus without thinking about when to stop." Complete.
- [x] 1.2b **Anything missing?** ✅ What about "ending the sprint"? The user needs to know when 96 minutes is done. That's part of sub-result 3 (transitions) — the final transition IS sprint completion.
- [x] 1.2c **Anything that doesn't contribute?** ✅ Cut "Cycle Awareness" (was v1 sub-result 5) — planetary day/moon phase doesn't help you focus. Moved to extensions.

**Cycle 2 — Sequence & Felt Experience**

- [x] 1.2d **Natural sequence?** ✅ Breathe → See → Flow → Know. You arrive, settle, work, and see context. Intuitive.
- [x] 1.2e **Each feel like a WIN?** ✅ Each has a "moment": calm breath, seeing the structure, not deciding to pause, seeing progress in the day.
- [x] 1.2f **3 words or less?** ✅ "Breathe & Center", "See Your Sprint", "Flow With Transitions", "Know Your Day." All ≤4 words.

**Cycle 3 — What Cycles 1-2 Missed**

- [x] 1.2g **Any duplicates?** ✅ No — each is distinct. Breathe ≠ See ≠ Flow ≠ Know.
- [x] 1.2h **Any doing too much?** ⚠️ "Flow With Transitions" combines two things: (a) automatic transition prompts and (b) micro-break suggestions. But these happen at the same moment, so it's one experience, not two. OK.
- [x] 1.2i **User walk-through momentum?** ✅ "I breathed and calmed down → I can see the whole sprint → I'm working and the transitions happen on their own → I can see my day position." Each flows into the next.

**→ No changes needed.** Sub-results are clean: 4 felt wins, no fluff, clear sequence.

---

### 1.3 Screens

The key design principle: **everything is one screen — the clock face.** There are no pages, no navigation. There are two MODES (ambient + sprint) and information layers.

| # | Screen/Mode | Sub-Result | What user sees |
|---|------------|-----------|---------------|
| 1 | **Ambient Mode** | Breathe & Center | Breathing circle (center) + "Enter Deep Focus" button + current energy context. This is the landing state. |
| 2 | **Sprint Mode** | See Sprint + Flow Transitions + Know Day | Sprint ring shows 4 phases. Current phase highlighted. Phase name + time remaining visible. Day position shown. Transition prompts appear at phase boundaries. |
| 3 | **Settings** (overlay) | — | Wake/sleep time, breath duration, toggle outer rings. Modal over the clock. |

**What was CUT from v1:**
- "Day View" as a separate screen concept — merged into Sprint Mode (day position is just text, not a separate layer)
- "Cycle Rings" as a separate screen concept — outer rings are decorative context, not a "screen"

---

### 🔥 ROAST 1.3: Screens

- [x] Any screen doing TWO things? ⚠️ Sprint Mode shows sprint + day info, but day info is one line of text ("Sprint 2 of 3"). That's context, not a second purpose. OK.
- [x] Any two screens doing the SAME thing? ✅ No — Ambient = resting state, Sprint = working state, Settings = config.
- [x] Walk the sequence — anything missing? ✅ User opens → Ambient → taps Enter Deep Focus → Sprint → sprint ends → Ambient. Complete loop.

**→ No changes needed.** 3 clean screens/modes.

---

### 1.4 Screen Details (Three Dan Tians)

#### Ambient Mode

| Dan Tian | Content |
|----------|---------|
| 🫀 Heart | "I feel my breath slowing. I'm landing in my body." |
| 🧠 Mind | "I see where I am energetically — it's a good time to work." (or: "It's evening, rest.") |
| 🔥 Gut | **"ENTER DEEP FOCUS"** — one button. Clear, result-oriented. |

#### Sprint Mode

| Dan Tian | Content |
|----------|---------|
| 🫀 Heart | "I feel held by the rhythm. I don't have to manage my time." |
| 🧠 Mind | "I'm in the BUILDING phase. 14 minutes left. Sprint 2 of 3." |
| 🔥 Gut | No CTA during sprint — the rhythm IS the guide. At transitions: *"Breathe. What emerged?"* |

#### Settings (Overlay)

| Dan Tian | Content |
|----------|---------|
| 🫀 Heart | "I can customize this to my rhythm." |
| 🧠 Mind | "Wake time, sleep time, breath speed, outer rings toggle." |
| 🔥 Gut | Each setting has an immediate slider/toggle. Changes apply live. |

---

### 🔥 ROAST 1.4: Screen Details

- [x] Are any Heart entries generic? ✅ No — "I feel my breath slowing" and "I feel held by the rhythm" are specific bodily sensations.
- [x] Does every Mind entry teach ONE clear thing? ✅ Ambient = "good time to work or rest." Sprint = "phase + time + day position."
- [x] Is every CTA a result verb? ✅ "Enter Deep Focus" (not "Start Timer" or "Begin"). Sprint mode has no CTA — the rhythm guides.

**→ No changes needed.**

---

### 1.5 Extensions

**Artifacts produced:**
- Sprint log (timestamp, completed yes/no, duration)
- Daily rhythm data (how many sprints, average completion)

**Emotional states:**
| Mode | Emotion |
|------|---------|
| Ambient | Calm, centered, ready |
| Sprint Entry | Purposeful, oriented |
| Sprint Focus | Flow, absorbed |
| Sprint Exit | Reflective, satisfied |
| Sprint Complete | Accomplished, ready for rest |

**Completion criteria:**
- Continuous tool — no "done" state
- Success = user opens it daily and works with it
- Measurable: did user complete at least 1 full sprint?

**Skip paths:**
- User can ignore transition prompts — clock continues, no nagging
- User can end sprint early (long-press)
- User can hide outer rings for minimal mode

**Bridges:**
- Standalone v1 — no connection to Evolver Platform data
- Future: sprint logs feed into Evolver's daily loop / QoL tracking
- Future: personalized guidance based on Evolver profile

**Extensions (NOT core — available but not essential):**
- Outer cycle rings (week, month, quarter, year, moon phase, planetary day/hour)
- These are DECORATIVE CONTEXT — beautiful but not needed for the core transformation
- Available via settings toggle

---

### 🔥 ROAST 1.5: Extensions

- [x] Is completion criteria specific? ✅ "Did user complete at least 1 full sprint?" — measurable, yes/no.
- [x] Does skip path make sense? ✅ Ignoring prompts doesn't break anything. Early exit is allowed. Outer rings are toggleable.
- [x] Are bridges bidirectional? ⚠️ Not yet — v1 is standalone. But that's by design. Future bridge is noted.

**→ No changes needed.**

```

**Key:** Sprint ring shows progress. Phase name + time + day position below. Guidance text at transitions.

---

### 🔥 ROAST 1.6: Wireframes

- [x] Is the CTA above the fold? ✅ "Enter Deep Focus" is dead center.
- [x] Breathing room? ✅ Minimal text, lots of space.
- [x] Could you delete anything? ⚠️ The legend (PLAN/BUILD/COMM./INTEGR.) — could be removed in minimal mode. But it helps first-time users understand the 4 colors.

**→ No changes needed.**

---

## 🔥 ROAST GATE 1: PRODUCT (Final Gate)

### Flow Walkthrough

- [x] User opens Equilibrium → sees breathing circle + "ENTER DEEP FOCUS" + optional energy context
- [x] User breathes with circle → feels calmer
- [x] User taps "ENTER DEEP FOCUS" → sprint begins
- [x] Sprint ring appears showing 4 phases
- [x] Phase 1 (Planning, 24 min): "What is the one thing?" → user sets intention → works
- [x] Phase 2 (Building, 24 min): "Build. Create. Execute." → deep work
- [x] Phase 3 (Communicating, 24 min): "Share. Polish. Ship." → output work  
- [x] Phase 4 (Integrating, 24 min): "Integrate. Reflect. Rest." → winding down
- [x] Sprint ends → return to ambient → gentle message: "Stand. Walk. No screens."
- [x] Day position updates → shows "Sprint 1 of 3 complete"

### Roast Cycles

- [x] **Cycle 1 — Usability:** User can understand what to do in 3 seconds (center button = start, ring = progress, text = context). ✅
- [x] **Cycle 2 — Edge cases:** What if user opens mid-day? Shows current sprint position. What if outside work hours? Shows "rest" guidance. ✅
- [x] **Cycle 3 — What 1-2 missed:** The 6 outer rings — are they confusing? Answer: They're decorative context, toggleable. Core experience is breathing + sprint ring + text. The outer rings are for users who WANT cosmic context. They don't interfere with the core loop.

### Fix Applied

The main fix from v1 → v2 concept:
1. **Information hierarchy clarified:** Sprint ring + phase name + time = CORE. Outer rings = OPTIONAL EXTENSION.
2. **"Cycle Awareness" demoted:** From core sub-result to extension. It's beautiful but not essential.
3. **Screen count reduced:** From 4 conceptual screens to 2 modes + 1 overlay. Simpler mental model.
4. **Master Result sharpened:** From "harmonious, cycle-aware deep work" to "shows you exactly where you are in your work rhythm." Concrete, not aspirational.

**✓ Checkpoint:** Phase 1 PRODUCT complete. The concept is sharp. Moving to Phase 2.

---

## PHASE 2: ARCHITECTURE

> v1 architecture is solid. This section confirms what stays and what changes.

### 2.1 Module Boundaries

| Element | Value | Changed from v1? |
|---------|-------|-------------------|
| **Entry** | URL: `/equilibrium/` (standalone Vite app) | No |
| **Exit** | Close tab (no exit flow) | No |
| **Data in** | `Date.now()` (time), `localStorage` (preferences, sprint state) | No |
| **Data out** | Sprint logs to `localStorage` | No |
| **Auth** | None — standalone, no login | No |

### 2.2 Routing

| Route | Screen | Guards |
|-------|--------|--------|
| `/equilibrium/` | The Clock (Ambient + Sprint modes) | None |
| Settings | Modal overlay (no route) | None |

**No changes from v1.** One route, one page, two modes.

### 2.3 Data Schema

**No database — all localStorage.** No changes from v1.

| Key | Type | Purpose |
|-----|------|---------|
| `eq-preferences` | JSON | Wake/sleep time, breath duration, outer rings toggle |
| `eq-active-sprint` | JSON | Start time, current pulse, current phase, paused flag |
| `eq-sprint-log` | JSON array | Completed sprints with timestamps |

### 2.4 Shell & Layout

- **No nav, no header, no footer** — fullscreen clock
- **Always focus mode** — this IS a focus tool
- **Responsive:** iPad landscape (primary), portrait, desktop, phone
- **No scroll** — everything fits viewport

**No changes from v1.**

### 2.5 State Management

| State | Storage | Resume logic |
|-------|---------|--------------|
| Preferences | `localStorage` — survives reboot | Load on init |
| Active sprint | `localStorage` — survives refresh | If sprint exists and not expired (< 96 min), resume |
| Sprint log | `localStorage` — indefinite | Append on sprint complete |
| Cycle positions | **Computed from `Date.now()`** | No storage needed |

**No changes from v1.**

### 🔥 ROAST GATE 2: ARCHITECTURE

**Navigation walkthrough:**
- [x] User opens `/equilibrium/` → Clock loads in ambient mode ✅
- [x] User clicks Back in browser → leaves app (expected) ✅
- [x] User refreshes mid-sprint → sprint resumes from localStorage ✅
- [x] User returns next day → sprint expired, ambient mode shows ✅

**Roast cycles:**
- [x] Cycle 1: Entry/exit clean. No broken states. ✅
- [x] Cycle 2: Data flow is pure — everything from `Date.now()` + localStorage. No server dependencies. ✅
- [x] Cycle 3: What about multiple tabs? → Last-write-wins on localStorage. Acceptable for v2.

**✓ Checkpoint:** Architecture confirmed. No changes needed. Moving to Phase 3.

---

## PHASE 3: UI

> This is where the v2 changes mostly happen. The CONCEPT has been sharpened in Phase 1 — now the UI must MATCH the new concept.

### 3.1 Visual Rules (What changes)

**KEEP:**
- Dark background (`#0a0f1a`), gold accents, serif/sans split
- Phase colors: orange (Planning), blue (Building), green (Communicating), purple (Integrating)
- Breathing circle animation (5.5s in/out)

**CHANGE:**
1. **Sprint ring prominence** — During sprint mode, the sprint ring (innermost work ring showing 4 phases) should be CLEARLY the most prominent ring. Thicker, brighter, more saturated.
2. **Outer rings opacity** — Outer rings (sprint/day/week/month/quarter/year) should be much more faint in sprint mode. They're context, not the focus.
3. **Text area cleanup** — Too many text lines below the clock. Simplify to:
   - Sprint mode: Phase name + time + day position (3 lines max)
   - Ambient mode: Energy context + CTA (2 lines max)
4. **Remove synthesis line** — "☀️ Vitality & Purpose flowing through 🗣️ Clarity & Communication" is poetic but adds noise. The status bar at the bottom already conveys this.

### 3.2 Building Blocks

All existing — no new components needed:
- Breathing circle (SVG animation)
- Segmented ring (SVG arcs)
- Position dot (SVG circle)
- Phase legend (4 colored dots + labels)
- Status bar (bottom text)
- CTA button ("Enter Deep Focus")
- Settings panel (modal)

### 3.3 Layout Templates

**No change from v1.** Fullscreen, centered clock, text below, status bar at bottom.

**Responsive priorities:**
1. iPad landscape (primary) — full clock + text
2. Desktop — same as iPad
3. iPad portrait — squeeze text slightly
4. Phone — outer rings collapse, text wraps

### 3.4 Brandbook Integration

**Emotional mode:** Calm + purposeful. Dark mode only. Bio-Light dark variant.
**Voice:** Quiet, confident. Not motivational. Not nagging. Like a wise friend who stays calm.
**Gradients:** Subtle — ring glows, not backgrounds.

### 3.5 Micro-interactions

**KEEP:**
- Breathing circle scale animation
- Phase transition color shifts on rings
- Position dot smooth movement

**ADD:**
- Sprint start: rings subtly pulse once, outer rings dim
- Phase transition: gentle glow on the transitioning ring segment
- Sprint end: all rings briefly glow gold, then return to ambient

### 🔥 ROAST GATE 3: UI

**Gestalt check:**
- [x] First impression: Dark, mysterious, purposeful. ✅
- [x] Premium feel: Yes — the clock looks like a real instrument, not a prototype. ✅
- [x] Consistency: All text is the same serif/sans system. All colors from the palette. ✅
- [x] Breathing room: The key fix — reduce text lines below clock. Currently 5-6 lines → target 3 max.

**Roast cycles:**
- [x] Cycle 1: The synthesis line ("Vitality & Purpose flowing through Clarity & Communication") is noise. Remove it — the status bar already shows this info. ✅
- [x] Cycle 2: Compare to a real watch — a Rolex doesn't show you the hour, the minute, AND a paragraph explaining them. Show time remaining LARGE, phase name MEDIUM, everything else SMALL or absent. ✅
- [x] Cycle 3: The outer rings during sprint mode — do they distract? Answer: Currently yes. They should fade to 20-30% opacity during sprint to keep focus on the sprint ring.

**Fix list for Phase 4 implementation:**
1. Remove synthesis line from ambient mode
2. Simplify text to 3 lines max (guidance, phase+time, day position)
3. Fade outer rings during sprint mode (reduce opacity to 0.25)
4. Make sprint ring thicker/brighter during sprint
5. Add "Sprint X of Y" day-position text in sprint mode

**✓ Checkpoint:** UI spec complete. Fix list ready for implementation.

---

## PHASE 4: VIBE-CODING

### 4.1 Files to Modify

No new files — all changes are in existing files:

| File | Change |
|------|--------|
| `clock.ts` | Remove synthesis line rendering. Adjust ring opacity in sprint mode. Make sprint ring thicker. |
| `main.ts` | Update text rendering to 3-line max. Add "Sprint X of Y" text. |
| `guidance.ts` | No changes needed — guidance messages are already clean. |
| `style.css` | Add transition for ring opacity changes. |
| `cycles.ts` | No changes needed — cycle math is solid. |

### 4.2-4.4 Implementation

See code changes below.

### 4.5 Verification

- [ ] `npx tsc --noEmit` — zero errors
- [ ] Browser visual check — ambient mode clean, sprint mode focused
- [ ] Text area has ≤3 lines in both modes

### 4.6 AI Self-Test

- [ ] Browser screenshot of ambient mode
- [ ] Browser screenshot of sprint mode
- [ ] Visual comparison against v1 screenshot
