# Equilibrium v2 — Progress Tracker

**Started:** 2026-02-11 12:40
**Status:** Phase 1: PRODUCT ✅ → Phase 2: ARCHITECTURE
**Previous version:** [equilibrium_tracker.md](./equilibrium_tracker.md) (v1 — all phases complete)
**Spec:** [equilibrium_v2_product_spec.md](./equilibrium_v2_product_spec.md)

> **Context:** This is the SECOND cycle through the playbook. v1 exists and runs. 
> The goal is to sharpen the concept — the tech mostly stays, the product definition gets refined.

## INPUT ✅ COMPLETE (5/5)

- [x] 1. **ICP:** Alexander + founders who do 2-4 deep work sprints/day, want rhythm not arbitrary timers
- [x] 2. **Transformation:** "No rhythm, push or drift" → "Glance → know exactly where I am → focus flows"
- [x] 3. **Pain:** "4 hours later I'm drained", "Pomodoro kills my flow", "I skip breaks then crash"
- [x] 4. **Dream Outcome:** "Glance → 8 min focus left → keep going with confidence", "3 sprints, energized not drained"
- [x] 5. **Action:** Open on iPad, breathe with circle, tap Enter Deep Focus, follow the rhythm

## PHASE 1: PRODUCT ✅ COMPLETE

- [x] 1.1 **Master Result** — "Equilibrium shows you exactly where you are in your work rhythm so you can focus without thinking about when to stop."
- [x] 🔥 ROAST 1.1 — All 9 checks pass. 12-year-old test ✅. Point B now includes specific "14 min left" moment.
- [x] 1.2 **Sub-Results (4):** Breathe & Center, See Your Sprint, Flow With Transitions, Know Your Day
  - **CUT from v1:** "Cycle Awareness" (week/month/quarter) demoted to extension — beautiful but doesn't help you focus
- [x] 🔥 ROAST 1.2 — All 9 checks pass. No duplicates, clear sequence, each is a felt win.
- [x] 1.3 **Screens (2 modes + 1 overlay):** Ambient Mode, Sprint Mode, Settings overlay
  - **CUT from v1:** "Day View" and "Cycle Rings" as separate screens — merged/demoted
- [x] 🔥 ROAST 1.3 — Clean. No screen does two things. Complete loop: Ambient → Sprint → Ambient.
- [x] 1.4 **Screen Details** — Dan Tians defined for all 3 screens. CTAs are result-oriented.
- [x] 🔥 ROAST 1.4 — Pass.
- [x] 1.5 **Extensions** — Sprint log, emotional states, completion criteria, skip paths, bridges. Outer cycle rings explicitly marked as "decorative context, not core."
- [x] 🔥 ROAST 1.5 — Pass.
- [x] 1.6 **Wireframes** — Ambient + Sprint ASCII wireframes. CTA centered. Minimal text.
- [x] 🔥 ROAST 1.6 — Pass.
- [x] 🔥 **ROAST GATE 1 — PASS** — Flow walkthrough complete. 3 roast cycles done. Key fix: information hierarchy clarified (sprint = core, outer rings = optional extension).
