## How This Document Works

This playbook distills the full genius-to-revenue pipeline from 6 source documents into one linear path. Each step includes:

- **What** — the transformation this step achieves
- **Key principle** — the underlying theory (from Integral Transactional Field Theory)
- **How** — the practical execution
- **Example** — Alexander's FMF offer as the running case
- **Check** — the human-in-the-loop gate question
- **Source** — where to go deeper

The companion workflow (`.agent/workflows/genius-business.md`) turns this playbook into a step-by-step recipe any AI agent can execute.

> **Critical sequence:** Step 0 (Myth) is the seed from which all others grow. Steps 1-5 are **discovery** (inner → outer). Steps 6-10 are **expression** (outer → market). Skipping 0-5 is why most businesses fail.

---

## Step 0: MYTH — The Cosmological Claim

**What:** Answer: *"What must be true about reality for my work to be inevitable?"*

**Key Principle:**
> The myth is not a marketing artifact. The myth is the acorn from which every business artifact grows. If the myth is true, every downstream artifact becomes self-evident. — February 17, 2026

**How:**
1. State the deepest truth your work embodies — not what you do, but what must be true for what you do to matter
2. Test it: say it to 10 people. The ones whose chest tightens — that's your tribe. The ones who nod politely — not yours.
3. Verify: does every artifact below (Unique Gift, Offer, Tribe, Pain, Promise, Method) trace back to this myth? If not, something is misaligned.

**FMF Example:**
> *"There exists a venture so structurally yours that building it IS your personal development, and developing yourself IS building it."*

If that's true → finding FMF is the most important thing a founder can do → every founder in transition suffers from unfound FMF → the method must start with uniqueness → the offer writes itself.

**Check:** *"If someone disproves this, does my entire business collapse?"* — If yes, it's your myth. If no, you're stating a preference, not a truth.

---

## Step 1: SEED — Unique Gift Articulation (Appleseed)

**What:** Answer "Who am I at my brightest?" — Articulate your uniqueness in words.

**Key Principle:**
> "Until uniqueness is languaged, it cannot be communicated, encoded into products, or distributed at scale." — Unique Business Playbook

**How:**
1. Answer 12 perspective questions (values, strengths, experiences, what others say)
2. AI synthesizes into Unique Gift card
3. 3x Roasting cycles (invisible to user)
4. Output: Vibrational Key, Bullseye Sentence, Compound Archetype

**FMF Example:**
> Alexander's Unique Gift lives at the intersection of systems thinking, integral philosophy, and venture building. His vibrational key: *"Crystallizing invisible human potential into visible, tradeable structures."*

**Check:** *"Does this feel true?"* — Emotional resonance, not intellectual agreement.

---

## Step 2: OFFER — Genius Crystallization (Excalibur)

**What:** Transform genius into a tradeable offer. Answer: "What do I sell?"

**Key Principle:**
> "Value crystallization = energy flow becoming legible, countable, intentional, transactable." — ITFT

**How:**
1. From Unique Gift → derive what transformation you deliver
2. Define: form (session/container/product), promise, deliverable, pricing, channel
3. Name the offer
4. Define initial ICP hypothesis (v1, will deepen in Step 3)

**FMF Example:**
| Element | Value |
|---------|-------|
| **Offer** | Founder-Market Fit Session |
| **Form** | 90-minute 1:1 session |
| **Promise** | From scattered "what should I build?" → crystallized clarity on the one venture built on who you actually are |
| **Deliverable** | Unique Gift card, venture fit analysis, 30-day action plan |
| **Pricing** | $197 (pilot), $397 (standard) |
| **Channel** | Cal.com booking from landing page |

**Check:** *"Would you sell this tomorrow?"* — If the answer is "not yet", the offer isn't crystallized.

---

## Step 3: ICP — The Tribe You Represent

**What:** Define WHO needs this most. Not a demographic — a person you recognize.

**Key Principle:**
> "ICP = the lens that focuses sunlight into fire. Too broad = warmth but no ignition. Precisely shaped = inevitability." — ITFT

**How:**
1. Start with: "The tribe I represent" — who are the people like you?
2. Document **internal qualifiers** (recognition filters, not messaging)
3. Describe their **life situation** — not demographics, but the moment they're in
4. Assess their **awareness stage** (Schwartz 1-5)

**FMF Example:**

**Internal Qualifiers:** Founders, digital nomads, AI-fluent, MBA-minded, systems thinkers, plant medicine path, multilingual, sense of planetary mission, growth-oriented.

**Life Situation:** In extended transition. Burning savings. Partner is asking questions. Capable but stuck. Breakthrough feels perpetually around the corner but never arrives.

**Awareness Stage:** Stage 2 (Problem Aware) — They know something's off, but blame externals (resources, team, timing).

**The Recursive Insight:** *"I am my own most important client. By teaching and sharing, I also grow the fastest. Put the mask on yourself first."*

**The Recursive Shadow:** Once uniqueness is articulated, watch for the shadow — the limiting belief that is the unique gift inverted. For a founder whose gift is clarity, the shadow will be: *"I don't have enough clarity yet to act."* The practitioner's role is to help them see that the condition for acting was met long ago — they kept looping because more depth was always available. (See [unique_gift_philosophy.md](../01-vision/unique_gift_philosophy.md) — Discovery 1.)

**Check:** *"Is this a real person you know?"* — You should be able to name 5 people who match.

## Step 4: PAIN — The 5-Layer Slicer

**What:** Uncover the decision pressure that makes your offer non-optional. Answer: "Why can't this wait?"

**Key Principle:**
> "A transaction happens ONLY when Attention + Pain + Purchasing Power overlap. Without Pain = procrastination." — ITFT

> "C = painful thing they already feel, described how they'd say it." — PMF Hypothesis Formula

**How:** Apply the 5-Layer Pain Slicer sequentially:

| Layer | Question | Produces |
|-------|----------|----------|
| 1. **Struggle** | What would they say if you asked "what's going on?" | Surface problem in their words |
| 2. **Pressure** | What's pushing them toward a decision NOW? | Forcing functions + compound loop |
| 3. **Consequences** | What do they experience daily? | Body, mind, emotions, relationships, identity |
| 4. **Cost of Inaction** | What's the price of doing nothing? | 6-month projection → usually resignation |
| 5. **Urgency Levers** | What makes NOW different from "eventually"? | Countdown mechanisms |

**Then extract:** Self-Language Inventory (8-12 phrases they say to themselves)

**FMF Example:**

| Layer | Key Finding |
|-------|-------------|
| **Struggle** | "I can't figure out which venture to go all-in on" |
| **Pressure** | Savings declining + partner conversations + self-image erosion (compound loop) |
| **Consequences** | Chest tightness, scatter, oscillation between vision and despair, walking on eggshells around money |
| **Cost of Inaction** | Not bankruptcy — **resignation**. Shelving the dream. "I'll come back to it when…" (They won't.) |
| **Urgency** | Runway countdown, relationship tipping point, AI market window closing |

**Self-Language:** "I've been in this transition for too long" / "I'm running out of runway" / "I'm so much more capable than my results show" / "I feel like I'm drilling hoping I'm almost through the wall"

**Check:** *"Would they cry reading this?"* — If the description doesn't hit a nerve, you're still too abstract.

---

## Step 5: TP — Transformational Promise

**What:** Crystallize Point A → Point B in one sentence.

**Key Principle:**
> "Business happens when timeless essence meets temporal pressure." — ITFT

**How:**
1. Point A = the felt experience (from Layer 3 of the slicer — consequences)
2. Point B = the lived reality after transformation
3. The Bridge = your method (from Step 6)
4. Run through 3x Roasting cycles using TP Deepening Template

**PMF Hypothesis Formula:**
```
If A had B, they'd have no more C.

A = who (from Step 3 ICP)
B = what you give them (from Step 2 Offer)
C = what they'd stop suffering (from Step 4 Pain)
```

**FMF Example:**
```
If a capable founder in extended transition (A)
had structural clarity on which venture is built on who they actually are (B),
they'd have no more grinding uncertainty, scattered energy,
dreaded partner conversations, and identity paradox (C).
```

**One-sentence TP:** *"From 'I know I'm close but I can't see the path' → to 'I know exactly what to build and why it's mine to build.'"*

**Check:** *"Can you say this naturally in conversation?"* — If it sounds like marketing copy, iterate.

**Source:** [tp_deepening_template.md](../02-strategy/tp_deepening_template.md)

---

## Step 6: BLUEPRINT — Your 3-Step Method

**What:** Name your unique methodology. Make it memorable and explainable in 30 seconds.

**How:**
1. Identify the transformation mechanism: "Converts [X] into [Y]"
2. Name 3 phases (verb-based, alliterative or thematic)
3. Each phase: name, description, key question answered, tangible output
4. Sequence logic: "Without Phase 1, Phase 2 fails because…"

**FMF Example:**
```
MAP → MATCH → MOVE

Phase 1: MAP    — Map your Unique Gift across 12 perspectives
Phase 2: MATCH  — Match your genius to a market that needs it NOW
Phase 3: MOVE   — Move with a 30-day action plan to first revenue
```

**Check:** *"Could someone explain this in 30 seconds?"*

## Step 7: POSITIONING — How You Say It

**What:** Create messaging variations for different contexts.

**Key Principle:**
> "You don't sell. You signal. You don't hunt. You hum — and those tuned to your frequency find you." — ITFT

**How:**
Generate 3 versions:

| Version | Leads With |
|---------|------------|
| **Pain-Forward** | Their wound (for Stage 2 awareness) |
| **Method-Forward** | Your unique approach (for Stage 3-4) |
| **Result-Forward** | The outcome (for Stage 5) |

**FMF Example:**

**Pain-Forward (primary — because ICP is Stage 2):**
> "You know you're capable of building something extraordinary. So why is this transition taking so long?"

**Method-Forward:**
> "I use the MAP→MATCH→MOVE system to help founders find the venture that's built on who they actually are."

**Result-Forward:**
> "In 90 minutes, walk out knowing exactly what to build and why it's yours to build."

**Check:** *"Can you say this naturally?"* — Must sound like you, not like a template.

> [!IMPORTANT]
> **The Myth IS the Funnel.** The deepest positioning isn't pain-forward or result-forward — it's *myth-forward*: stating the underlying truth your work embodies. The myth: *"There exists a venture that is so structurally yours that building it IS your personal development, and developing yourself IS building it."* Anyone who feels that resonate in their bones — that's the client. They self-select by resonance. No persuasion needed. (See [unique_gift_philosophy.md](../01-vision/unique_gift_philosophy.md) — Discovery 4.)

---

## Step 8: LANDING PAGE — Where They Buy

**What:** Build the page that converts attention into booking.

**Key Principle:**
> "The landing page follows the wound, not the solution. For Stage 2 awareness: lead with pain recognition, then introduce the diagnosis."

**Landing Page Formula (from ITFT):**
```
1. "EXPERIENCE THIS?" (pain recognition — their self-language)
2. Transformational Promise (pain → dream outcome)
3. CTA Button
4. Dream outcome in 3 steps (your Blueprint)
5. What experiencing each step looks like
6. Social proof / about
7. Booking CTA
```

**FMF Example:**
- Hero: *"You know you're capable. So why is this transition taking so long?"*
- Problem: Self-language phrases from the slicer
- Solution: MAP → MATCH → MOVE
- For/Not For: Filter section qualifying right-fit clients
- About: Brief credibility
- CTA: Cal.com booking link

**Check:** *"Would the ICP read the first two sentences and feel seen?"*

**Source:** [integral_transactional_field_theory.md](../01-vision/integral_transactional_field_theory.md) — Landing Page Formula

---

## Step 9: DISTRIBUTION — Where They Find You

**What:** Choose max 3 channels. Master one before adding another.

**3 Channels:**

| Channel | Purpose |
|---------|---------|
| **Warm Network** | First 5-10 clients from people who already know you |
| **Content Home** | One platform matched to where ICP hangs out |
| **Referral Loop** | Built from delivery — satisfied clients bring the next ones |

**FMF Example:**
1. **Warm:** 30-50 founders from Alexander's network → personal message
2. **Content:** LinkedIn (where founders in transition scroll)
3. **Referral:** "Who else do you know in this situation?" at end of session

**Check:** *"Is this sustainable for your capacity?"*

---

## Step 10: LAUNCH — First Revenue in 30 Days

**What:** Convert the pipeline into daily actions toward first revenue.

**How:**
1. Set revenue target (e.g., $1,970 = 10 sessions × $197)
2. Work backwards: sales needed → conversations needed → outreach needed
3. Week-by-week focus: Activate → First Sale → Momentum → Convert

**Conversion Math:**
```
Target:        $1,970
Sessions:      10 × $197
Conversations: 20 (50% conversion)
Outreach:      50 (40% response rate)
Daily:         ~3 messages per day for 2 weeks
```

**Check:** *"Are daily actions achievable?"*

---

## Where to Go After Step 10

Once first revenue validates the offer, the pipeline extends:

| Next Step | What | Source |
|-----------|------|--------|
| **Value Ladder** | Build 5-tier offer ecosystem | unique_business_playbook.md — Workflow 7 |
| **Product** | Turn validated offer into software | integrated_product_building_workflow.md |
| **Scale** | Grow from 1:1 to 1:many | distribution_playbook.md |

> [!NOTE]
> **Venture Creation vs. Venture Building.** This playbook addresses *venture creation* — the upstream problem of identifying which venture is structurally the founder's. The difference matters: the entire venture building industry assumes the founder already knows what to build. They don't address the selection problem — which is the root cause of 90% of startup failure (building the wrong thing, for the wrong reasons, in the wrong sequence). Our unique contribution lives here.
