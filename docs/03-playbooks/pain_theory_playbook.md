## Core Artifacts (Terminology)

| Abbreviation | Full Name | Russian | Description |
|--------------|-----------|---------|-------------|
| **ICP** | Ideal Client Profile | ИКП (Идеальный Клиентский Профиль) | WHO needs this most |
| **TP** | Transformational Promise | ТО (Трансформационное Обещание) | Point A → Point B |

---

## The Transformational Promise (TP)

```
POINT A ────────────────→ POINT B
 (Pain)                    (Desired Outcome)
 
"Shore"                    "Dream Island"
Where they are now         Where they want to be
```

**Point A** = Current state = The PAIN
**Point B** = Desired outcome = The DREAM

The client is on the shore, looking at the island. They want to get there but don't know how.

## The 5-Layer Pain Slicer

Pain is not monolithic. It has **layers**, and each layer reveals messaging language. Apply these sequentially — each goes deeper.

> *Applied correctly, this slicer produces the exact phrases your ICP uses to describe their situation — their self-language. These phrases become your messaging.*

### Layer 1: What They're Struggling With (Борьба)

The **surface problem** they'd name if you asked them directly. This is what they'd tell a friend.

**Questions to uncover:**
- What would they say if you asked "what's going on?"
- What do they complain about?
- What do they Google at midnight?

**What to listen for beneath it:** What they WON'T say unprompted but feel deeply.

### Layer 2: Pressure (Давление)

What's **pushing them toward a decision**. External and internal forces creating a closing window.

**Questions to uncover:**
- What's making this urgent NOW (not "someday")?
- What external clocks are ticking? (financial runway, deadlines, market windows)
- What relationship dynamics are creating pressure?
- What self-image erosion is happening?

**Key insight:** Pressure compounds. Financial stress → partner tension → self-doubt → decreased output → slower progress → more financial stress. Map the **loop**, not just the sources.

### Layer 3: Consequences (Последствия)

What they **experience daily** because of this problem — body, mind, emotions, relationships, output, identity.

**Questions to uncover:**
- What does a bad day feel like in their body?
- What is their inner dialogue when they're alone?
- How does this affect their most important relationship?
- Where is their energy going that it shouldn't?

### Layer 4: Cost of Inaction (Цена бездействия)

The price of doing **nothing**. Project forward 6-12 months.

**Questions to uncover:**
- What will their life look like in 6 months if nothing changes?
- What gets permanently lost (not just delayed)?
- What is the real cost — usually not bankruptcy, but **resignation**: settling for a misaligned life.

### Layer 5: Urgency Levers (Рычаги срочности)

The specific mechanisms that make **now** different from "eventually."

**Questions to uncover:**
- What countdown is already running? (savings, patience, market window)
- What tipping point is approaching in their relationships?
- What compounding cost are they paying per month of delay?
- What upcoming life event forces self-assessment? (birthday, anniversary, end of year)

## The 5 Stages of Awareness (Eugene Schwartz Model)

| Stage | Name | Description | Example (Toothache) |
|-------|------|-------------|---------------------|
| **1** | Unaware | Doesn't know they have a problem | Slight discomfort, ignored |
| **2** | Problem Aware | Knows the problem exists | "My tooth hurts, I admit it" |
| **3** | Solution Aware | Looking for solutions, doesn't know options | "What can I do about this?" |
| **4** | Product Aware | Knows different solutions exist | Dentist vs painkiller vs grandpa's vodka cotton |
| **5** | Most Aware | Comparing specific options, ready to buy | Looking at Google Maps for dentists |

### Key Insight (Jobs To Be Done)

At Stage 4, products from COMPLETELY DIFFERENT CATEGORIES compete:

```
DENTIST vs PAINKILLER vs VODKA COTTON
   ↓           ↓              ↓
 All solve the same JOB: "Make my tooth stop hurting"
```

**The dentist competes with grandmother's remedy.** Category is irrelevant — the JOB is what matters.

## The Pain Mapping Template

For ICP Deepening, map each dimension:

| Dimension | Question | Client's Self-Language |
|-----------|----------|------------------------|
| **1. Struggle** | What would they say if asked "what's going on?" | |
| **2. Pressure** | What's making this urgent NOW? | |
| **3. Consequences** | What are they experiencing daily? | |
| **4. Cost of Inaction** | What happens in 6 months if nothing changes? | |
| **5. Urgency Levers** | What countdown is already running? | |
| **Awareness Stage** | 1-5, where is your ideal client? | |

## The Recursive Shadow of Pain

> *See [unique_gift_philosophy.md](../01-vision/unique_gift_philosophy.md) for full synthesis.*

Pain has a recursive dimension that standard pain mapping misses:

**A person's unique gift generates a limiting belief that is structurally identical to the gift, but inverted.**

| Gift | Shadow Belief | Pain Pattern |
|------|---------------|-------------|
| Clarity | "I need more clarity before I can act" | Infinite preparation loop |
| Connection | "I feel isolated" | Withdrawal from the very relationships they'd enrich |
| Building | "Nothing I build is finished" | Starting new projects instead of shipping |
| Teaching | "I'm not qualified enough" | Over-studying instead of sharing |

**The practical implication**: When slicing pain (Layers 1-5), also ask: *"What is this person's unique gift?"* — then check if their pain is the shadow of that gift. If it is, the intervention is not more preparation. The intervention is **helping them see that the base case was met long ago** — they have enough to act.

**For the practitioner**: The recursive shadow also explains underpricing. If your gift is making the invisible visible, your shadow is: "my own value is invisible to me." This is not a character flaw — it is the structural property of recursion operating on the practitioner.

## Value Perception Coefficient

*(To be expanded with Business Transaction Theory playbook)*

The perceived value is always less than or equal to actual value:

```
Perceived Value = Actual Value × Perception Coefficient

where 0 ≤ Perception Coefficient ≤ 1
```

**Goal of product packaging:** Move the coefficient as close to 1 as possible. Help the client SEE the full value.
