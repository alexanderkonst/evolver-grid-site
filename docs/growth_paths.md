> Sequences of transformational upgrades on each vector

*Updated: 2025-01-06*

## Design Principles

Each step is an **upgrade** with a real shift:
- Something SHIFTS in the person
- They can FEEL the difference
- They can NAME the transformation
- Unlock = visible progress

**Terminology:**
- "Immersive Experience" or "Activation" — not "meditation"
- "Upgrade" or "Unlock" — not "exercise"

---

## Practice Anatomy

Every meaningful practice follows this structure:

```
LEARN → EXPERIENCE → INTEGRATE
(see)    (live through)  (embody)
```

**Practice bundles:**
- Morning Practice (learn + experience + integrate)
- Evening Practice (reflect + release + integrate)
- Ad-hoc Practice (quick activation)
- Custom Practice (player-created combinations)

Practices can be 5 min or 60 min — structure stays the same.
