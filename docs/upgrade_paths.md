## Design Principle

Each step is an **upgrade**, not just a practice:
- Something SHIFTS in the person
- They can FEEL the difference
- They can NAME the transformation
- Unlock = visible progress

**Terminology:**
- Use "Immersive Experience" or "Activation" — not "meditation"
- Use "Upgrade" or "Unlock" — not "exercise"
