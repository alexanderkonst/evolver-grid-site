## Stage Transitions

| From → To | Key Unlock |
|-----------|------------|
| 1 → 2 | Initial feedback validates direction |
| 2 → 3 | Unit economics work, ready to scale |
| 3 → 4 | Core markets saturating, need expansion |
| 4 → 5 | Growth demonstrated, ready for larger raise |

## How to Use This Map

### The Process

1. **Locate yourself** — Where are you on each dimension?
2. **Find your bottleneck** — Which dimension is lagging behind?
3. **Find your growth driver** — Which dimension, if advanced, unlocks others?
4. **Zoom-in** — Look at specific transition for those 2 cells
5. **Find an expert** — Someone who passed this exact transition
6. **Get guided through** — Accelerate with specific help

### Important Note

> Round A → Round B is **not about raising investment**.
> It's about transitioning from "early product" to "proven, scaling business."
> This path can be fully bootstrapped.

## Zoom-In: Transition Maps

Each cell transition can be examined in detail:

### Example: Product & Technology (Stage 1 → Stage 2)

| Aspect | Details |
|--------|---------|
| **Duration** | 2–4 months |
| **Goals** | Optimize MVP based on feedback, increase PMF, establish systematic improvement |
| **Actions** | Collect/analyze feedback, prioritize features by data, optimize codebase, implement QA, improve UX/UI |
| **Tools** | Analytics (Mixpanel), Feedback (SurveyMonkey), Agile/Scrum, Jira/Trello, Figma |
| **Experts Needed** | Product Manager, UX/UI Designer, Data Analyst, Developers, QA Engineer |
| **Success Metrics** | Load time -20%, bugs -30%, engagement +15%, churn -10%, conversion +25% |
| **Risks** | Misinterpreting feedback (mitigation: user interviews), Feature creep (mitigation: strict prioritization), Delays (mitigation: buffer time) |
| **Integration** | Align product changes with marketing for coordinated campaigns |

### Creating Your Zoom-In

For any cell, analyze:
1. **Typical Duration** — How long does this transition take?
2. **Transition Goals** — What does "done" look like?
3. **Actions & Processes** — What do you actually DO?
4. **Tools & Methodologies** — What helps accelerate?
5. **Expert Roles** — Who do you need?
6. **Success Metrics** — How do you measure progress?
7. **Risks & Mitigations** — What could go wrong?
8. **Integration Points** — How does this connect to other dimensions?
