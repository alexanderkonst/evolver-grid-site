# Roadmap by Category

## 📦 PRODUCT / MODULES

### Module Landings (Priority: HIGH | Target: Tomorrow)
**Idea #1:** Landing pages for every module!

Every module in the system gets its own landing page that explains:
- What the module does
- Transformational result
- How to use it
- How to co-create it

**Status:** 🎯 Tomorrow's scope of work

---

### Module Versioning (Priority: HIGH | Target: This Week)
**Idea #3:** Version the whole thing! Every module, every piece of documentation.

Create an underlying versioning scheme:
- Module versions (v1.0, v1.1, v2.0)
- Documentation versions
- Changelog per module

**Status:** Will be added when creating module landings

---

### User Artifact Versioning (Priority: HIGH | Target: This Week)  
**Idea #4:** Version each person's artifacts.

Track evolution of user-generated content:
- Zone of Genius v1.0, v1.1...
- Genius Business v1.0, v1.1...
- Landing Page v1.0, v1.1...
- Distribution Strategy v1.0...
- Mission v1.0...
- Assets v1.0...

Creates feeling of progress and evolution. "Your Zone of Genius has evolved 3 times!"

**Status:** Part of module versioning scope

---

### Holonic Page Navigation (Priority: MEDIUM | Target: This Week)
**Idea #8:** How to show and navigate the holonic pages?

Visual representation of nested module structure:
- Zoomable hierarchy
- Breadcrumb navigation
- Module relationships

**Status:** 🔄 Design exploration needed

---

## 📣 MARKETING & GROWTH

### Invite System (Priority: MEDIUM | Target: February)
**Idea #2:** Invite people to every module — to use, to co-create, to meet others working on this.

Every module can be:
- Used individually
- Co-created (contribute improvements)
- Social space (meet other users of this module)

**Status:** February scope

---

### Doubling Invites / Waitlist (Priority: MEDIUM | Target: February)
**Idea #5:** Invite users in doubling batches.

Growth strategy:
1. First 2 invites
2. First 5 invites
3. First 10 invites
4. First 100 invites
5. First 500 invites
6. Waitlist for the rest

Build a tool for this. Karime as second user.

**Status:** February - Growth hacking scope

---

### Autonomous Agent Invites (Priority: HIGH | Target: March)
**Idea #6:** Platform invites as a living organism.

The platform will reach out using agents:
- First invites are manual (Alexander)
- Then OS does the invites autonomously
- AI agents identify and reach potential users

**Status:** March - Autonomous growth scope

---

## 🎨 DESIGN / UX

### Fast Design Workflow (Priority: HIGH | Target: Today/Tomorrow)
**Idea #7:** How to make & develop design for the OS fast?

Initial ideas:
- Screenshots → send to AI → get improvements
- Standardize patterns
- Taxonomize page types
- Harmonize (layout, sizes)
- Minimalism as principle
- Types of pages catalog

**Status:** 🎯 Next sprint today

---

## 📦 PARKED FEATURES

### Events Module (Luma-like)
**Status:** Parked | **Priority:** Medium

Three clicks after signup:
1. See list of events
2. Pick an event
3. Get confirmation

Routes: `/events`, `/events/:id`

---

### Admin Panel & Dashboard
**Status:** Parked | **Priority:** Future

For community leadership:
- Member overview
- Invite members
- Manage branding
- View aggregate patterns
- Manage events

Routes: `/admin`, `/admin/members`, `/admin/branding`

---

### Placeholder Strategy
For unbuilt features, show:
- **[Coming Soon]** badge
- Grayed out module in sidebar
- Tooltip: "This feature is being built"

---
