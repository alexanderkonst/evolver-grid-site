## ✅ Completed

### Documentation Foundation
- [x] Manifesto
- [x] Prime Radiant Spec (L0-L5)
- [x] Game Architecture (4 loops, 4 quadrants, Digital Village)
- [x] Game Design Principles
- [x] Transformation Engine (5 vectors → 8 domains)
- [x] Customer Journey Map v5
- [x] Being/Doing Ontology (Purpose = ZoG, Mission = Contribution)
- [x] 5 Vectors locked (Spirit, Mind, Emotions, Genius, Body)

### Key Decisions
- [x] "Me", "My Life", "My Next Move" framing
- [x] 4 Loops = 4 Buildings (Self-Understanding, Transformation, Economic, Social)
- [x] Digital Village concept (minimal-first, spectrum to VR)
- [x] Universal language (Self-Development → Life Results)

## 🔄 In Progress

### Vector Growth Sequences
| Vector | Status |
|--------|--------|
| Spirit | ⬜ Not started |
| Mind | ⬜ Not started |
| Emotions | ⬜ Not started |
| Genius | ⬜ Not started |
| Body | ⬜ Not started |

---

## 📋 Next Steps (Sequence)

### 1. Vector Sequences (Alexander)
Define growth path for each of 5 vectors.

### 2. Enriched Customer Journey
Integrate sequences into journey map.

### 3. User Flows
Screen-by-screen with actions/transitions.

### 4. Wireframes
Minimal black/white layouts.

### 5. Build Modules

### 6. Weave into Journey

## 🛠️ Implementation Notes

### MVP Recommendation Logic
**Simple first**, complex later:
```
MVP: Lowest QoL domain → random unlocked action from that domain
v2:  Add vector progress, time since last practice, user preferences
```

### First Action Timing
- **First 1-3 actions**: 1-3 minutes, easy wins
- **After that**: Progressive challenge, digestible chunks
- NOT every action is 1-3 min

### QoL Zoom-In (Later)
- Current: 8 domains × 10 stages = 80 positions
- Future: 8 × 10 × 10 = 800 positions (substages)
- Enables fast visible progress

## 🎉 Design Principles (Always Hold)

1. **One next move** — Never overwhelm
2. **Self-development → Life results** — 5 vectors drive 8 domains
3. **First-person** — "Me", "My Life", "My Next Move"
4. **Freedom with guidance** — Open-world feel
5. **Every action = XP** — Everything counts
6. **Celebratory beats** — Reinforce motivation at every transition
