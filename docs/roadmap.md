## Immediate Next Steps (Monday onwards)

### 1. Customer Journey Map
**Create a click-by-click journey of every user action**

- Entry point → First value moment
- Every screen, every click, every decision
- Map emotions at each step
- Identify friction points and dopamine hits

### 2. Module Mapping
**Connect journey steps to existing/needed modules**

| Journey Step | Module | Status |
|--------------|--------|--------|
| Genius discovery | Zone of Genius | ✅ Built |
| Life assessment | Quality of Life Map | ✅ Built |
| Practice selection | Library | ✅ Built |
| Mission discovery | Mission Discovery Tool | ⚪ Separate tool |
| Asset inventory | Asset Inventory | 🟡 Spreadsheet |
| Skill progression | Skill Trees | 🟡 Partial |
| Daily recommendations | Recommendation Engine | 🟡 Basic |
| Matchmaking | AI Matchmaking | 🔵 Concept |
| Genius monetization | Genius Economy | 🔵 Concept |
| ... | ... | ... |

### 3. Missing Modules
**List and prioritize modules that don't exist yet**

To be discovered through customer journey mapping.

### 4. Module Transitions
**Create smooth connections between modules**

- How does completing ZoG lead to next action?
- What happens after QoL assessment?
- How do side quests connect to main quest?

### 5. Game Progression UX
**Onboarding + Ongoing Gameplay**

- First 5 minutes experience
- First session completion
- Return visit experience
- Long-term progression visualization

## The Core Question ✅ ANSWERED

> ~~How do we merge the game experience with the transformational experience?~~

**See [Transformation Engine](./transformation_engine.md)** — the synthesis is documented.

Key insight: **Inner work (5 vectors) → Outer results (8 domains)**
- XP tracks the input (practices)
- QoL measures the output (life improvement)
- Decimal stages (2.3 → 2.7) show visible progress in weeks
- The game IS the transformation visualized

## Design Principles to Hold

1. **One next move** — Never overwhelm
2. **Inner begets outer** — 5 vectors drive 8 domains
3. **Play is transformation** — Not separate activities
4. **Every action = XP** — Everything counts
5. **Show progress visually** — Make growth tangible
