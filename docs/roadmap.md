> What's next for the Member Portal

*Last updated: 2025-01-04 (Day 2 of Network School Sprint)*

## ✅ Completed (Day 1-2)

### Documentation Foundation
- [x] Manifesto (coherence tuning fork)
- [x] Prime Radiant Spec (L0-L5 architecture)
- [x] Game Architecture (implementation reference)
- [x] Game Design Principles (11 Reality RPG rules)
- [x] Transformation Engine (5 vectors → 8 domains)
- [x] Impact Mapping (6 pillars, 45 focus areas)
- [x] Module Registry (LEGO blocks catalog)

### Customer Journey
- [x] Customer Journey Map v2 (3 portals, unified onboarding)
- [x] Daily Loop Spec v2 ("My Next Move" design)
- [x] Vector Sequences template (for Alexander to fill)

### Key Decisions
- [x] "Me", "My Life", "My Next Move" framing
- [x] Not labeled "game" — gamified system
- [x] One profile per person (all data unified)
- [x] 6 action types (Practice, Profile Step, Microlearning, Life Action, Monetization Step, Connection)

## 🔄 In Progress

### Vector Growth Sequences
**Alexander to fill in recommended order of actions per vector**

| Vector | Status |
|--------|--------|
| Spirit | ⬜ Not started |
| Mind | ⬜ Not started |
| Emotions | ⬜ Not started |
| Uniqueness | � Example drafted |
| Body | ⬜ Not started |

---

## 📋 Next Steps

### 1. Fill Vector Sequences (Content)
Alexander defines the growth path for each vector:
- What microlearning comes first?
- What practices build on each other?
- What life actions make it real?

### 2. Implement Daily Loop v2 (Code)
Refactor GameHome.tsx to match new design:
- [ ] "Me" section (profile summary)
- [ ] "My Life" section (QoL snapshot)
- [ ] "My Next Move" (ONE recommended action)
- [ ] "Explore more" freedom mode
- [ ] Remove Main Quest / Side Quest / Upgrade cards

### 3. Action Type System (Code)
Create unified action type handling:
- [ ] Action type enum (practice, profile_step, microlearning, life_action, monetization_step, connection)
- [ ] XP award per vector
- [ ] Completion tracking
- [ ] Next action recommendation logic

### 4. Onboarding Flow Polish (Code)
Ensure smooth ZoG → QoL → Portal experience:
- [ ] Clear progression indicators
- [ ] "Unlock your growth drivers" messaging
- [ ] Celebration moments

## 🔜 Later (After Core Loop Works)

### Frameworks to Document
- [ ] Asset Mapping system
- [ ] Mission Discovery (Integral Society)
- [ ] Matchmaking algorithms
- [ ] Genius Monetization tech
- [ ] Destiny Pack concept

### Features to Build
- [ ] Decimal QoL stages (2.3 → 2.7)
- [ ] Per-vector levels (not just total XP)
- [ ] Microlearning content layer
- [ ] Monetization integration

## Design Principles (Always Hold)

1. **One next move** — Never overwhelm
2. **Inner begets outer** — 5 vectors drive 8 domains
3. **First-person** — "Me", "My Life", "My Next Move"
4. **Freedom with guidance** — Open-world feel
5. **Every action = XP** — Everything counts
