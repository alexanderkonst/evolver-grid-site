### Architecture Clarity
- [x] Being/Doing Ontology (Purpose = ZoG, Mission = Contribution)
- [x] 5 Growth Paths locked (Spirit, Mind, Emotions, Genius, Body)
- [x] 5 Game Spaces locked (Profile, Transformation, Marketplace, Matchmaking, Venture Co-op)
- [x] Key Distinction: Growth Paths (you change) vs Game Spaces (you act)
- [x] Core Insight: "Life results ← Self-development"
- [x] Journey Pattern: Same start → personalized divergence
- [x] Universal language: Buildings → Spaces, Vectors → Growth Paths

### Documentation
- [x] `game_architecture.md` — core structure
- [x] `game_design_principles.md` — single source for principles
- [x] `growth_paths.md` — transformational upgrades
- [x] `game_spaces.md` — capabilities per space
- [x] `session_log.md` — daily progress
- [x] Customer Journey Map v5

### Language Principles
- [x] Consistency: same term for same concept everywhere
- [x] Universality: works for spiritual, web3, corporate communities
- [x] 1% Better: compound growth that accelerates

## Design Principles (Reference)

| # | Principle |
|---|-----------|
| 1 | One Next Move — Never overwhelm |
| 2 | First action = 1-3 min easy win |
| 3 | Every action = XP |
| 4 | Celebratory beats at every transition |
| 5 | 1% better: daily → hourly → minute-level growth |
| 6 | Consistency + Universality in language |
| 7 | Growth Paths (you change) vs Game Spaces (you act) |
