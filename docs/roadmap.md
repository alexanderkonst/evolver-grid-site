# Roadmap: Next Phase

> What's next after the documentation foundation is complete

*Last updated: 2025-01-03 (Day 1 of Network School Sprint)*

## Immediate Next Steps (Monday onwards)

### 1. Customer Journey Map
**Create a click-by-click journey of every user action**

- Entry point → First value moment
- Every screen, every click, every decision
- Map emotions at each step
- Identify friction points and dopamine hits

### 2. Module Mapping
**Connect journey steps to existing/needed modules**

| Journey Step | Module | Status |
|--------------|--------|--------|
| Genius discovery | Zone of Genius | ✅ Built |
| Life assessment | Quality of Life Map | ✅ Built |
| Practice selection | Library | ✅ Built |
| Mission discovery | Mission Discovery Tool | ⚪ Separate tool |
| Asset inventory | Asset Inventory | 🟡 Spreadsheet |
| Skill progression | Skill Trees | 🟡 Partial |
| Daily recommendations | Recommendation Engine | 🟡 Basic |
| ... | ... | ... |

### 3. Missing Modules
**List and prioritize modules that don't exist yet**

To be discovered through customer journey mapping.

### 4. Module Transitions
**Create smooth connections between modules**

- How does completing ZoG lead to next action?
- What happens after QoL assessment?
- How do side quests connect to main quest?

### 5. Game Progression UX
**Onboarding + Ongoing Gameplay**

- First 5 minutes experience
- First session completion
- Return visit experience
- Long-term progression visualization

## The Core Question (Still Open)

> **How do we merge the game experience with the transformational experience?**

### The Pieces We Have

| Piece | Description |
|-------|-------------|
| **5 Development Vectors** | Spirit, Mind, Emotions, Uniqueness, Body |
| **8 QoL Domains** | Wealth, Health, Happiness, Love, Impact, Growth, Social, Home |
| **The Link** | Inner (5 vectors) begets Outer (8 domains) |
| **XP System** | Points earned for actions |
| **Practices** | Units of transformation (from Library) |
| **Levels** | Progression milestones |
| **Skill Trees** | Visual unlockable paths |
| **Explainers** | Educational content |
| **Microlearning** | Bite-sized knowledge |
| **Fundamentals** | Engine of human development |

### The Question

How do these all fluidly connect into:
1. A game that feels like a game (dopamine, progress, achievement)
2. A transformation engine that actually changes people
3. An experience that is both — not two things duct-taped together

**We haven't reached "absurd simplicity" yet.**

## Design Principles to Hold

1. **One next move** — Never overwhelm
2. **Inner begets outer** — 5 vectors drive 8 domains
3. **Play is transformation** — Not separate activities
4. **Every action = XP** — Everything counts
5. **Show progress visually** — Make growth tangible
