# User Journey: Linear Onboarding Sequence

> **Principle**: Self-First, Then Others  
> **Logic**: Clarity about self → Clarity about life → Clarity about action → Clarity about people

## The Linear Sequence

**One entry point. One path. Progressive unlock.**

| Step | Question | Space | Technology | Outcome |
|------|----------|-------|------------|---------|
| **1** | *What am I naturally best at?* | Zone of Genius | Appleseed | Core genius articulated |
| **2** | *How do I bring most value to others?* | Zone of Genius | Excalibur | Unique offer crystallized |
| **3** | *Where am I now?* | Quality of Life | QoL Assessment | 8 life domains mapped |
| **4** | *Where do I want to go?* | Quality of Life | Priority Picker | Top goals prioritized |
| **5** | *How do I get there?* | Growth | Recipe Screen | 5 Growth Paths ranked |
| **6** | *What's my next step?* | Daily Loop | Flywheel | First action unlocked |
| **7** | *Who are my people?* | Connect | Matching | Top match revealed |
| **8** | *What's mine to do?* | Mission | Discovery | Purpose clarified |

## Entry Point: Zone of Genius

**Why ZoG first?**
1. Instant WOW-effect (2 button clicks → life-changing clarity)
2. Answers the deepest question: "Who am I?"
3. Creates foundation for everything else
4. Low friction, high value

## Progressive Unlock Logic

```
┌──────────────────────────────────────────────────────────────────┐
│                                                                  │
│  GENIUS         LIFE          ACTION        PEOPLE               │
│  ───────        ────          ──────        ──────               │
│  Appleseed  →   QoL      →    Daily    →    Match                │
│  Excalibur  →   Priority →    Loop     →    Mission              │
│             →   Recipe                                           │
│                                                                  │
└──────────────────────────────────────────────────────────────────┘
```

Each step unlocks after previous is complete.

## Profile as Hub

Profile is **not** a step — it's a **container** that accumulates data from every step:

- ZoG data (archetype, talents, patterns)
- Excalibur data (offer, audience, transformation)
- QoL data (8 domains, stages, priorities)
- Growth progress (5 paths, current levels)
- Actions completed (quests, upgrades, XP)
- Mission/purpose (when discovered)

---

## Onboarding Progress Indicator

A persistent UI element showing:

```
[ ✓ Genius ] → [ ✓ Offer ] → [ ○ Life Map ] → [ · Growth ] → [ · Action ] → [ · People ]
```

**Design requirements:**
- Always visible during onboarding
- Shows completed steps, current step, upcoming steps
- Minimal, clean — like a game quest tracker
- Disappears after onboarding complete (moves to Profile)
