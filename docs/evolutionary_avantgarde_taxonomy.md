# Evolutionary Avantgarde Taxonomy

## The Thesis

> **Planetary OS is the coordination layer for the Evolutionary Avantgarde.**
>
> One launch sequence across all movements — **Sovereignty, Innovation, Regeneration, Awakening, Rooting, Creation**. People articulate and monetize their value, jump-start collaborations systematically, and the scattered movements building the future **coordinate as one meta-ecosystem**.

## What Is the Evolutionary Avantgarde?

Communities at the **frontier of technology AND consciousness**. They share three beliefs:

1. The current system is broken
2. A new paradigm is possible  
3. Change starts with **self-development → system change**

**Not just one movement.** A constellation of subcultures — each with different focus, unified by shared coordination infrastructure.

## First Level: Six Currents

| Current | Core Drive | Emoji |
|---------|------------|-------|
| **Sovereignty** | Decentralized governance, self-determination | 🌐 |
| **Innovation** | Building the future through ventures | 🚀 |
| **Regeneration** | Healing earth and systems | 🌱 |
| **Awakening** | Consciousness evolution, spiritual growth | ✨ |
| **Rooting** | Land-based intentional living | 🏡 |
| **Creation** | Art, culture, narrative as evolution vectors | 🎭 |

## Second Level: Subcultures Within Each Current

### 🌐 Sovereignty
- Network States (Balaji, Praxis, Próspera)
- DAOs & Protocol Communities
- Web3 / Crypto communities
- Digital nomad nations
- Parallel societies
- DeSci (decentralized science)

### 🚀 Innovation
- Venture studios
- Impact accelerators
- Startup ecosystems
- Founder communities
- Innovation labs
- Longevity / biohacking communities

### 🌱 Regeneration
- Regen communities (Gitcoin, Regen Network)
- Permaculture networks
- Climate tech collectives
- Circular economy projects
- Rewilding movements

### ✨ Awakening
- Spiritual ascension communities
- Meditation / contemplative networks
- Plant medicine circles
- Integral / metamodern groups
- Mystery schools
- Alternative education / unschooling

### 🏡 Rooting
- Ecovillages (GEN Global)
- Intentional communities
- New Earth settlements
- Coliving networks
- Land projects

### 🎭 Creation
- Cultural architects
- Narrative designers
- Memetic engineers
- Conscious media collectives
- Artist DAOs
- Worldbuilders / speculative designers

## Why This Matters

**Balaji = one channel** (crypto-native Network States).

**Planetary OS = all channels.** The infrastructure that lets a regeneration-focused permaculturist find a Web3 developer for a land DAO, or a spiritual teacher connect with a venture studio for scaling.

**Cross-pollination is the product.**

## One-Liner Variants

**Short:**
> "The coordination layer for the Evolutionary Avantgarde."

**Descriptive:**
> "Infrastructure uniting movements at the frontier of technology and consciousness — so people discover their genius, monetize it, and find collaborators across all subcultures."

**Mission:**
> "One meta-ecosystem. Six currents. One launch sequence. The scattered avantgarde coordinates at last."
