# Human Development 101 — Analysis

## Overview

**Source**: Integral Mystery School, Level 1, Month 1, Session 1
**Duration**: ~90 min training
**Core Theme**: A comprehensive map of how humans develop across multiple dimensions

---

## Integration with Existing Micro-Modules

**Already written (1.1-1.3):**
- 1.1: Growth Brings Results (Key 2 from training)
- 1.2: Dormant Potential (Key 1 from training)
- 1.3: Growth Acceleration Cycle (Learn → Experience → Implement)

**This training adds:**
- Quality of Life Map (external measurement)
- 5 Vectors framework (internal structure)
- Deep dives into each Vector
- Specific practices (5.5s breathing)

**Next logical module:** 1.4 — Five Vectors of Growth (overview)

## The 5 Vectors (Updated Terminology)

| Vector | Evolver Name | What Changes | Aspects |
|--------|--------------|--------------|---------|
| **Spirit** | Spirit Path | Perception bandwidth | Awareness + Sensitivity + **Character** |
| **Uniqueness** | Genius Path | Excitement/Alignment | Being (Purpose) + Doing (Mission) |
| **Mind** | Mind Path | Worldview + Inclusion | Cognition + Compassion |
| **Emotions** | Emotions Path | Autonomy/Choices | Processing + Integration |
| **Body** | Body Path | Vitality | Energy + Tension Release |

---

## SPIRIT Vector (Updated)

### Three Aspects (Three Dantians)

| Aspect | Dantian | Location | What Develops |
|--------|---------|----------|---------------|
| **Awareness** | Upper Dan Tian | Mind (Third Eye) | Clarity, resolution, cognitive perception |
| **Sensitivity** | Middle Dan Tian | Heart | Aliveness, juiciness, feeling into things |
| **Character** | Lower Dan Tian | Gut | Integrity, groundedness, ethical foundation |

### From Training:
- **Bits per second** analogy — more information perceived
- **VR headset upgrade** — resolution (awareness) + color (sensitivity)
- **States of Consciousness**: Gross → Subtle → Causal → Witness → Oneness

### Experience suggestions:
- Awareness: Noticing more details in surroundings
- Sensitivity: Feeling into colors, sounds, textures
- Character: Noticing integrity in decisions

---

## UNIQUENESS (Genius) Vector

| Aspect | Content |
|--------|---------|
| **What changes** | Excitement — frequency, levels, duration |
| **Feminine (Being)** | Purpose, authentic presence, gift |
| **Masculine (Doing)** | Mission, projects, expression |
| **Analogy** | Tightrope walker balance = alignment = flow |
| **Stages** | Unawareness → Accepting → Integrating → Embodying → Flow Mastery |

### Terms people use:
- Purpose, unique gift, superpower, medicine, craft, Unique Gift
- Mission, calling, tasks, projects

---

## MIND Vector

| Aspect | Content |
|--------|---------|
| **What changes** | Cognition (worldview) + Inclusion (love/compassion) |
| **Analogy** | Prism with distortions — grasping or avoiding |
| **Stages** | Survival → Sex/Pleasure → Power → Belonging → Achievement → Impact → Wholeness |
| **Key insight** | Worldviews clash (relationships, politics, business cultures) |

---

## EMOTIONS Vector

| Aspect | Content |
|--------|---------|
| **What changes** | Autonomy — choices where we had none |
| **Terms** | Cleaning up, Shadow, Trauma, Blockages, Limiting beliefs |
| **Key insight** | ONE dial for all emotions (suppress "negative" = suppress all) |
| **Layers** | Self-reflection → Childhood → Intergenerational → Collective → Karmic |

---

## BODY Vector

| Aspect | Content |
|--------|---------|
| **What changes** | Vitality — life energy available |
| **Analogy** | Vitruvian Man = natural enlightened body state |
| **Mechanism** | Trauma/tension → muscle knots → blocked energy |
| **Key practice** | 5.5s resonant breathing (HeartMath coherence) |

## Proposed New Micro-Modules

Based on what's NOT already covered in 1.1-1.3:

| # | Module Name | Main Idea | Experience |
|---|-------------|-----------|------------|
| **1.4** | Five Vectors of Growth | Overview: Spirit, Genius, Mind, Emotions, Body | Notice which feels most alive |
| **1.5** | The Five Paths Defined | What each path develops | — |

### Spirit Path additions:
| # | Title | Key Idea | Experience |
|---|-------|----------|------------|
| S0 | The Three Dantians | Awareness (Mind), Sensitivity (Heart), Character (Gut) | Body scan of 3 centers |
| S1 | Awareness vs Sensitivity | Resolution vs Juiciness | Notice detail + feel it |
| S2 | States of Consciousness | Gross → Subtle → Causal → Oneness | Brief glimpse of subtle |

### Other Paths (future):
- Training 2 (Acceleration Keys) will add acceleration practices
- Training 3 (Unique Gift) will deeply inform Genius Path

---

## Quality of Life Map (Sidebar Tool)

Not a micro-module but a **self-assessment tool**:
- 8 dimensions: Wealth, Health, Happiness, Love, Impact, Growth, Social, Home
- 10 stages each (survival → legacy)
- Can be used for baseline + progress tracking

---

## Key Takeaways for Content Production

1. **Modules 1.1-1.3 already cover Master Keys** — no duplication needed
2. **1.4-1.5 introduce the 5 Vectors** — foundation for all paths
3. **Spirit = Awareness + Sensitivity + Character** (3 dantians)
4. **Quality of Life Map** = assessment tool, not learning module
5. **5.5s breathing** = core practice for Body Path

## Next Steps

1. ✅ Analyzed transcript 1 (Human Development 101)
2. ⏳ Receive transcript 2 (Keys to Accelerating Growth)
3. ⏳ Receive transcript 3 (Unique Gift)
4. ⏳ Map how all three trainings complement existing 1.1-1.3
5. ⏳ Write 1.4 and 1.5 based on combined content
