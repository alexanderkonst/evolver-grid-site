> Reality RPG: Core principles that make the game actually work

*This is the SINGLE SOURCE for all design principles. Every feature should align with these.*

## The Essence

> **"See yourself as a character, your life as a world, and choose one next move."**

This is a **Reality RPG** — real life is the game, real transformation is the reward.

## Core Principles

### 1. Hero's Journey Structure
The player is the hero. The game follows the classic arc: Ordinary World → Call to Adventure → Threshold → Transformation → Return with gifts.

### 2. Challenge-Ease Balance
Not too easy (boring), not too hard (frustrating). The "flow state" zone. Quests scale to the player's current capacity.

### 3. Continuous Sense of Progress
The player should always feel they're moving forward, even if slowly. No dead ends. Every action counts.

### 4. Progress Made Visual
XP bars, level indicators, skill tree unlocks, streak flames. Show growth tangibly — don't just tell.

### 5. Growth Made Tangible
Abstract inner development → concrete visible markers. "You were here, now you're here."

### 6. Daily Game Screen
A home screen that makes sense *every day*. What do I do today? One glance → one action.

### 7. Skill Trees Exist
Visual, unlockable progression paths. Locked → available → in progress → completed. Creates anticipation and direction.

### 8. Continuous Character Creation + Development
- **Character Creation** = ongoing self-understanding (profile refinement)
- **Character Development** = ongoing transformation (practices, quests)

Both happen continuously, not once.

### 9. Recommended Next Move
The system always suggests what to do next. AI-driven, personalized to profile + current state.

### 10. One Next Move — Never Overwhelm
Home screen resolves to ONE action. Choice anxiety = death. Simplicity = engagement.

### 11. Storyline + Gamification
A basic narrative arc (Main Quest) gives meaning to the journey. Gamify as much as possible without feeling cheap.

### 12. 1% Better Principle
Compound growth that accelerates: 1% better every day → every hour → every minute. Actions can be as small as 1 minute.

## Growth Path Principles

Each step is an **upgrade** with a real shift:
- Something SHIFTS in the person
- They can FEEL the difference
- They can NAME the transformation
- Unlock = visible progress

**Terminology:**
- Use "Immersive Experience" or "Activation" — not "meditation"
- Use "Upgrade" or "Unlock" — not "exercise"

---

## Practice Anatomy

Every meaningful practice follows this structure:

```
LEARN → EXPERIENCE → INTEGRATE
(see)    (live through)  (embody)
```

**Practice bundles:**
- Morning Practice
- Evening Practice
- Ad-hoc Practice
- Custom Practice (player picks parameters, AI creates the combination)

Practices can be 5 min or 60 min — structure stays the same.

## The Five Loops (= 5 Buildings)

| Loop | Building | What Happens |
|------|----------|--------------|
| 1 | **Profile** | Self-understanding (ZoG + QoL + Tests + Assets) |
| 2 | **Transformation** | Growth through practice (5 vectors) |
| 3 | **Marketplace** | Monetization (offers, sales, revenue) |
| 4 | **Matchmaking** | Connections (geniuses, teams, orgs) |
| 5 | **Venture Co-op** | Collective building (co-op, tools) |

---

## Self-Development → Life Results

| Inner (5 Vectors) | Outer (8 Domains) |
|-------------------|-------------------|
| Spirit | Happiness, Growth |
| Mind | Impact, Growth |
| Emotions | Love, Social Ties, Happiness |
| Genius | Impact, Wealth |
| Body | Health, Home |

*Self-development drives life results. This is the transformation engine.*

## Anti-Patterns (What to Avoid)

❌ Overwhelming with options
❌ Abstract progress without visuals
❌ Gamification that feels fake/gimmicky
❌ Dead-end screens with no next action
❌ Guilt-inducing mechanics
❌ Complexity before earned
❌ Calling things "meditation" instead of "activation"
❌ Spreading design principles across multiple docs
