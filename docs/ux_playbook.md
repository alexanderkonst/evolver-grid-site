## First Principles of Product Design

*"The ultimate goal of every product is to become one button."*

## Part 1: First Principles — The Chain of Definitions

To build a user journey with absurd simplicity, we must first understand what it is at its deepest level.

### What is a User Journey?

A **user journey** is a sequence. A sequence of what? **Screens**.

### What is a Screen?

A screen is the **modular unit** — the most stable building block of a graphical interface.

### What is a Graphical Interface?

An interface mirrors **how humans fundamentally interact with information**. It is a **bridge** that allows humans to act on reality. It is a technology, an instrument, a means of achieving a goal.

### Therefore:

```
User Journey = Sequence of Screens
Screen = Modular unit of Interface
Interface = Bridge to act on reality
```

Everything else is derived from this.

## Part 2: The Anatomy of a Screen

A screen breaks down modularly into **visual elements**. Each element has a role and may or may not be interactive. These elements can be viewed through several **dimensions** (плоскости):

### Dimension 1: Data Output (Information Delivery)

Communicating something to the user. This includes:

- **Raw information** — Text, symbols, data
- **Infographics** — Information *packaged* for optimal understanding and rapid comprehension
- **Formats** (in order of complexity): Symbol → Icon → Text → Audio → Video → Interactive 3D → VR → AR

### Dimension 2: Data Input (Information Request)

Requesting something from the user:
- Form fields, selections, uploads
- Must **minimize friction** — the user should be able to retrieve and provide this information effortlessly
- Simplest example: "Enter your name" or "Select a date"

### Dimension 3: Backend Program (The Engine)

The invisible logic that makes interactivity possible.

> A person doesn't need to understand how an engine works to drive a car — but without an engine, the car won't move. **A car without an engine is not a car — it's a cart without a horse. And a cart without a horse is not a cart — it's just a stand or a table.**

The same applies here: **an interactive element without a program behind it is not an interactive element — it's just visual decoration.**

### Dimension 4: Harmony (Beauty & Energy)

The function of visual design that creates a **feeling of harmony** through energetic impact on the person — improving their internal state.

This is not utilitarian. This is about **raising the user's internal harmony through aesthetic energy**.

### Dimension 5: Relationships Between Elements

Elements and screens can be:
- **Grouped** together
- **Encoded with logic** (if/then)
- **Positioned relative to each other** with purpose — showing their interrelationship through spatial arrangement

### Dimension 6: Function

Every element must have a **defined function**. There is always an optimization goal. No element exists without purpose.

> This is the difference between simple products and those burdened with unnecessary complexity — complexity that creates cognitive load, unpleasant usage feelings, and distracts from the elements that carry the core functional load.

---

## Part 3: The Master Parameter — Usability

**Usability** is the composite measure, the **master parameter** that includes everything we've discussed.

> We are writing **the theory of maximizing usability** through maximizing user journey quality. This theory will become a step-by-step instruction for vibe-coding modern products. Follow it, and you get incredible products. **Steve Jobs-level products.** That's the bar we're setting.

### The Usability Laws

| Principle | Effect |
|-----------|--------|
| Fewer screens | → Higher usability |
| Fewer buttons | → Higher usability |
| Simpler communication | → Higher usability |
| Fewer sub-results to reach the result | → Higher usability |

### The Limit: One Button

**The evolutionary goal of every product is to become one button.**

This is the limit. The user must express *some* intention to receive a result. In graphical interfaces, that's pressing a button. The button is the most intuitive human tool. Simpler would only be thought control.

> Like kitchen appliances — they must be absolutely clear in usage. A blender has essentially one button: on/off. A vacuum cleaner: on/off, retract cord. **This is the simplicity we're aiming for.** This is what Steve Jobs means when he compares kitchen appliances to computers.

Until we reach one button, every product is simply a **series of buttons** — the total result broken into a series of sub-results.

---

## Part 4: The Structure of a User Journey

### Start With the Result

Everything begins with **reverse engineering** the result the user should receive at the end. This applies to the entire journey and each of its parts.

If the result cannot be achieved in one step:
> "What sub-results lead us to the final result?"

We aim for the **minimum number** of sub-results.

### The Mapping

```
RESULT
  ├── Sub-result 1 → Screen(s)
  ├── Sub-result 2 → Screen(s)
  ├── Sub-result 3 → Screen(s)
  └── Final Result → End Screen
```

Each sub-result gets a screen (or minimal set of screens). **There must be logic between screens**, and the overall result determines both the first and last screens.

### First Screen (of entire journey)

- States **what result we will create** for the user
- Contains the **Magic Button**: "Start"

### Last Screen (of entire journey)

- Shows **the result that was created**
- Highlights **what we accomplished**
- Offers the **next step**: deeper engagement, adjacent result, another module, or a paid offering

---

## Part 5: Screen Templates

### The Start Screen (Per Sub-Result)

**Required elements:**
1. **Promise** — Offer the sub-result to the user
2. **Description** — Concise, clear, beautiful (minimum: icon + short text)
3. **Magic Button** — Call-to-action to begin

**Optional elements:**
- Infographics, video, beauty elements
- These don't serve core functional goals but may add value, usability, fun, or art

### The End Screen (Per Sub-Result)

Three required elements:
1. **The sub-result itself** — Show it
2. **Its value** — What's the benefit?
3. **How to use it** — The practical application

Plus:
4. **The next step** — What follows, and why it's valuable to take it

**Note:** The end screen of one sub-result and the start screen of the next *could* be combined, but to reduce cognitive overload, it's better to separate them.

### Sub-Screens (Information Chunking)

When one screen would have too much information:
> We break it into **sub-screens** — like how onboarding works: information broken into pieces that are easy to perceive and "live through."

Sub-screens must show:
- What comes next
- How much remains
- Where the user is in the sequence

This is achieved through **progress indicators** (bars, dots) — elements that **calm the user** because they know what's happening, how much is left, and that they're being informed.

### The Information Request Screen

When you need input from the user:

1. **What is needed** — Clearly state what information you're requesting
2. **Why it's needed** — How this input creates the result they want
3. **Input field** — With clear instructions, optimized for **minimum friction**
4. **Submit button** — Labeled with the sub-result, not just "Submit"

---

## Part 6: Navigation

Navigation allows the user to **teleport** simply and clearly to any step in product usage.

Core navigation elements:
- **Back** — Return to previous step (if logic allows)
- **Skip** — Move past current step
- **Restart** — Begin from the start
- **Save** — Preserve progress

---

## Part 7: The Button

The button is the atomic unit of user action.

### Button Elements

1. **Visual design** — Clear, clickable, inviting
2. **Call-to-action** — 1-3 words maximum (ideally 1-2)
3. **The promise** — The text names the result of pressing it

### Multiple Buttons

When logic branches, multiple buttons split users into different paths. But default to one button per screen.

---

## Part 8: Optional Elements

Everything beyond the required Start Screen, End Screen, and Button is **optional**:

- Additional screens for **beauty**
- Screens for **user education** (if needed)
- Screens for **transformational experience**
- Elements for **fun, play, delight**
- Elements that serve **no functional purpose at all — i.e., art**

When done with taste, each of these increases overall product quality. They represent quality parameters that may or may not fall under usability — but they matter.

---

## Part 9: The Playbook (Step-by-Step)

### Step 1: Define the Result
What does the user receive at the end of this product/module?

### Step 2: Break Into Sub-Results
What intermediate results lead to the final result?
*(Minimize these. Fewer = higher usability.)*

### Step 3: For Each Sub-Result, Design:
- **Start screen**: Promise + Magic Button
- **End screen**: Result + Value + Usage + Next Step

### Step 4: For Information Requests:
- What's needed + Why it matters
- Simple input field + Labeled submit

### Step 5: Add Navigation
- Back, Skip, Restart, Save as appropriate
- Progress indicators (calming function)

### Step 6: Add Optional Elements
- Beauty, transformational experience, fun, art

### Step 7: Vibe-Code It
This specification becomes instructions for AI. AI can:
- Define results
- Break into sub-results
- Write all components
- Generate the product

## Part 10: The Meta-Insight

> What we have just done is define **the deepest principles of web design** — the foundation on which all internet interfaces are built, without needing to know anything about web design in advance.

From these first principles, we can:
- Add any functionality
- Play with any parameters
- Assemble any screen, any user journey

**Like LEGO blocks, these primitives combine into anything.**

This is vibe-coding: Describe what you want, structured by these principles, and AI builds it.

## Appendix: AI Prompt Structure

When using AI to vibe-code, provide:

```
RESULT: [What the user gets]

SUB-RESULTS:
1. [First sub-result]
2. [Second sub-result]
3. [Third sub-result]

FOR EACH SUB-RESULT:
- Start screen: [Promise + button text]
- Input needed: [What + why]
- End screen: [Result shown + value + next step]

NAVIGATION: [Which elements needed]

STYLE: [Harmony/beauty notes]
```

AI handles the rest.
