## Core Artifacts (Terminology)

| Abbreviation | Full Name | Russian | Description |
|--------------|-----------|---------|-------------|
| **ICP** | Ideal Client Profile | ИКП (Идеальный Клиентский Профиль) | WHO needs this most |
| **TP** | Transformational Promise | ТО (Трансформационное Обещание) | Point A → Point B |

---

## The Transformational Promise (TP)

```
POINT A ────────────────→ POINT B
 (Pain)                    (Desired Outcome)
 
"Shore"                    "Dream Island"
Where they are now         Where they want to be
```

**Point A** = Current state = The PAIN
**Point B** = Desired outcome = The DREAM

The client is on the shore, looking at the island. They want to get there but don't know how.

## The Anatomy of Pain

Pain has multiple components:

### 1. Decision Pressure (Давление к решению)

The force pushing the person toward making a decision. Something MUST change.

**Questions to uncover:**
- What is making this urgent NOW?
- What has changed that created this pressure?
- What deadline (real or felt) exists?

### 2. Felt Consequences (Ощутимые последствия)

The tangible, real effects of the problem on their life RIGHT NOW.

**Questions to uncover:**
- What are you experiencing daily because of this?
- How does this affect your energy/mood/relationships?
- What opportunities are you missing?

### 3. Cost of Inaction (Цена бездействия)

What happens if they DON'T solve this? The price of doing nothing.

**Questions to uncover:**
- What will your life look like in 1 year if nothing changes?
- What is this problem costing you (money, time, health, relationships)?
- What will you regret not doing?

### 4. Stakes (Что на кону)

What is REALLY at stake beyond the surface problem?

**Questions to uncover:**
- Deep down, what does solving this mean to you?
- What becomes possible when this is solved?
- What are you fighting for?

## The 5 Stages of Awareness (Eugene Schwartz Model)

| Stage | Name | Description | Example (Toothache) |
|-------|------|-------------|---------------------|
| **1** | Unaware | Doesn't know they have a problem | Slight discomfort, ignored |
| **2** | Problem Aware | Knows the problem exists | "My tooth hurts, I admit it" |
| **3** | Solution Aware | Looking for solutions, doesn't know options | "What can I do about this?" |
| **4** | Product Aware | Knows different solutions exist | Dentist vs painkiller vs grandpa's vodka cotton |
| **5** | Most Aware | Comparing specific options, ready to buy | Looking at Google Maps for dentists |

### Key Insight (Jobs To Be Done)

At Stage 4, products from COMPLETELY DIFFERENT CATEGORIES compete:

```
DENTIST vs PAINKILLER vs VODKA COTTON
   ↓           ↓              ↓
 All solve the same JOB: "Make my tooth stop hurting"
```

**The dentist competes with grandmother's remedy.** Category is irrelevant — the JOB is what matters.

## The Pain Mapping Template

For ICP Deepening, map each dimension:

| Dimension | Question | Client's Answer |
|-----------|----------|-----------------|
| **Decision Pressure** | What's making this urgent NOW? | |
| **Felt Consequences** | What are you experiencing daily? | |
| **Cost of Inaction** | What happens if you don't solve this? | |
| **Stakes** | What's really at stake for you? | |
| **Awareness Stage** | 1-5, where is your ideal client? | |

## Value Perception Coefficient

*(To be expanded with Business Transaction Theory playbook)*

The perceived value is always less than or equal to actual value:

```
Perceived Value = Actual Value × Perception Coefficient

where 0 ≤ Perception Coefficient ≤ 1
```

**Goal of product packaging:** Move the coefficient as close to 1 as possible. Help the client SEE the full value.
