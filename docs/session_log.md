> Chronicle of building the Member Portal of the Planetary OS

---

## Day 1 — Friday, Jan 3, 2025

**Location**: Network School, Forest City, Malaysia
**Time**: ~afternoon–11pm local time

### What We Built

| Item | Description |
|------|-------------|
| **Manifesto** | Unified Humanity Manifesto as coherence tuning fork |
| **Prime Radiant Spec** | L0-L5 foundational architecture |
| **Game Architecture** | Implementation-level UX and loops reference |
| **Game Design Principles** | 11 Reality RPG rules |
| **Transformation Engine** | Core synthesis: 5 vectors → 8 domains |
| **Impact Mapping** | Integral Society Blueprint (6 pillars, 45 focus areas) |
| **Module Registry** | LEGO blocks catalog for Planetary OS |
| **Roadmap** | Next phase strategic work |
| **4-Loop Model** | Character Creation, Character Transformation, Genius Monetization, Multiplayer |

### Key Insights Crystallized
- Body path naming unified (removed "Grounding"/"Rooting Down")
- 4-loop model as core game structure
- QoL decimal stages concept (2.3 → 2.7 visible progress in weeks)
- Inner (5 vectors) → Outer (8 domains) transformation engine

### Code Changes
- `domains.ts` — Body path label fix
- `skillTrees.ts` — Body skill tree ID
- `GameDodecahedron.tsx` — Icon variable naming
- `SkillTrees.tsx` — Domain mapping
- `GameHome.tsx` — Alt text fix

## Day 2 — Saturday, Jan 4, 2025 (Alexander's Birthday 🎂)

**Location**: Network School, Forest City, Malaysia
**Time**: ~2pm onwards

### What We Built

| Item | Description |
|------|-------------|
| **Customer Journey Map v3** | With dopamine moments marked at every step |
| **Daily Loop Spec v2** | "My Next Move" — ONE action, dynamically chosen |
| **Gamification Mechanics** | 12 engagement hooks + Retention Flywheel |
| **White-Label Strategy** | Invisible rails, visible storefronts approach |
| **Vector Sequences Template** | Growth path per vector (for Alexander to fill) |
| **Updated Roadmap** | Clear completed/in-progress/next structure |

### Key Decisions Made
- **Not "game"**: Gamified system, but don't label it as a game
- **Three portals, one experience**: Transform / Monetize / Belong → same onboarding
- **Black hole, not a brand**: Invisible infrastructure, visible communities
- **No emperor, thriving for all**: Value flows to all participants
- **Build ONE first**: MVP for one community, then extract theme layer

### Strategic Insights Crystallized
- **Content is covered**: World-class integral microlearning already exists
- **Life actions covered**: ZoG → monetization → matchmaking is enough to retain
- **Retention flywheel**: Gamification + Rabbit holes + Monetization + Social
- **Cross-community network effects**: Matchmaking across all communities

### Design Patterns Established
- First-person language ("Me", "My Life", "My Next Move")
- ONE recommended action (no choice paralysis)
- Dopamine moments designed into every transition
- Freedom mode via "Explore more →"
- All actions award XP to relevant vector

## Day 2 Continuation — Sunday, Jan 5, 2025

**Location**: Network School, Forest City, Malaysia

### What We Built

| Item | Description |
|------|-------------|
| **Customer Journey Map v5** | Numbered steps, ZoG branching, Tamagotchi moment, Zoom-In, Unlocks table, all design questions answered |
| **Universal Language** | "Self-Development → Life Results" (not inner/outer) |
| **8 Domain Examples** | Complete vector→domain mapping for all life areas |
| **Unlocks Per Phase** | ZoG→QoL→First Action→Skill Trees→Monetization |
| **First Action Design** | 1-3 min easy wins per domain |
| **Onboarding Definition** | ZoG (~5 min) + QoL (~5 min) + First Action (1-3 min) |

### Key Decisions Made
- **Skill trees unlock at 5 actions** (not immediately)
- **Personalized recommendations = big deal** (not same for everyone)
- **Most users start with Wealth/Genius** (economic vector)
- **Step Banner** shows current step + upcoming in simple language

### Design Patterns Refined
- Universal language for any community (spiritual, web3, crypto, etc.)
- "Results follow development" — no magic button
- Infographic shown BEFORE My Next Move
- Each domain explained with its vector drivers

## Day 2 Evening — Sunday, Jan 5, 2025

### What We Added

| Item | Description |
|------|-------------|
| **Being/Doing Ontology** | Purpose = ZoG (being), Mission = Contribution (doing) |
| **4 Quadrants Mapping** | Q1=Self-Understanding+Transformation, Q2=Social, Q3=Economic, Q4=Systemic (under the hood) |
| **4 Core Loops** | Self-Understanding, Transformation, Economic (merged w/ Venture Co-op), Social |
| **5 Vectors Locked** | Spirit, Mind, Emotions, Genius, Body |
| **Digital Village Concept** | Buildings as capabilities, themeable for white-label, UI spectrum (text→VR) |
| **Minimal-First Decision** | Stay black/white text buttons until journey is complete |

### Key Decisions Made
- **"Uniqueness" → "Genius"** everywhere (consistency)
- **Spirit stays** (most universal despite some allergies)
- **Economic + Venture Co-op = one loop** (Q3)
- **Social = Q2** (not reducible to Emotions vector)
- **Digital Village** = future game screen architecture

### Roast & Refinement (9pm)
Critical review of what we built. Outcomes:
- **Celebratory beats** added to Design Principles
- **Simple MVP recommendation logic**: Lowest QoL → random unlocked action
- **First action timing**: 1-3 min for first few only, progressive challenge after
- **4 Buildings** (matches 4 loops), not 7
- **QoL Zoom-In** marked as "Later" feature
- Confidence confirmed: prototypes exist, pilots lined up, modules tested

## Day 3 — Monday, Jan 6, 2025

**Location**: Network School, Forest City, Malaysia

### What We Built

| Item | Description |
|------|-------------|
| **Daily Loop v2 Shell** | New "Me / My Life / My Next Move" layout behind a feature flag |
| **Unified Action Schema** | Single action shape to normalize quests, practices, upgrades |
| **Action Engine** | Legacy-to-unified recommendation builder with quick-win bias |
| **Action Mapping Doc** | Source-by-source mapping for action fields and defaults |
| **Refactor Plan Updates** | Growth path/genius naming consistency + Phase tracking |

### Key Decisions Made
- Use "growth path" language everywhere (files, UI, schema)
- Use "genius" instead of "uniqueness" for naming consistency

---

## Status: Where We Are

**✅ Complete:**
- Customer Journey Map v5
- Game Architecture (loops, quadrants, village)
- Gamification Mechanics doc
- White-Label Strategy doc
- Being/Doing ontology
- 5 Vectors locked
- Roadmap refreshed
- Vector Sequences v1 (Genius detailed, others outlined)
- Simple 13-year-old pitches

### End of Day 2 (~11:45pm)

**Genius Vector Sequence captured:**
- MVP: ZoG → Apply → Tests → Micros → Unique Offering → Genius Business
- Later: Co-op, Matchmaking, Tools, Advanced Micros

**Architecture Insight:**
- Genius is richest (economic engine, entry point)
- Other vectors are practice/learning-heavy (appropriate)
- "Later" items = Depth (mastery) + Width (multiplayer/connections)
- MVP is single-player; multiplayer is phase 2

**Overall Assessment:**
> "You have enough. The engine is designed. Now it needs to run."

## 🧍 End-of-Day Standup (12:15am, Jan 6)

### What We Accomplished Today

| Area | Accomplishment |
|------|----------------|
| **Ontology** | Being/Doing locked (Purpose=ZoG, Mission=Contribution) |
| **Architecture** | 4 Loops = 4 Buildings = 4 Quadrants (coherent) |
| **Vectors** | 5 locked: Spirit, Mind, Emotions, Genius, Body |
| **Genius Sequence** | MVP path defined + Later items categorized |
| **Infographic** | Life Results → Self-Development (inverted, correct direction) |
| **Language** | Universal: "Self-Development drives Life Results" |
| **Digital Village** | 4 buildings, themeable, minimal-first |
| **Pitches** | 13-year-old friendly versions created |
| **Player Journey** | 5-step arc: Know → Master → Monetize → Find → Build |
| **Roast** | Critical review done, concerns addressed |

### Architecture Clarifications Made
- Buildings = visible, clickable
- Loops/Quadrants = invisible, under the hood
- "My Next Move" = crosses all loops
- 5-step arc = implicit narrative, not explicit UI

### What We Did NOT Do (Intentionally Parked)
- Spirit vector sequence details
- Mind/Emotions/Body sequences
### Final Clarification (1am)
- **5 Loops = 5 Buildings = 5 Journey Steps** (not 4)
- Profile → Transformation → Marketplace → Matchmaking → Venture Co-op
- Know → Master → Monetize → Find → Build

---

## 📅 Tomorrow's Plan (Jan 6)

1. **Draft other vector sequences** (Spirit, Mind, Emotions, Body)
2. **User Flows** — translate customer journey to screens
3. **Map modules onto flows** — where each module fits
4. **Design onboarding v2** — next iteration
5. **Sequence recommended actions** — with leeway for AI
6. **Scope module build** — what to build first
