## Day 1 — Friday, Jan 3, 2025

**Location**: Network School, Forest City, Malaysia
**Time**: ~afternoon–11pm local time

### What We Built

| Item | Description |
|------|-------------|
| **Manifesto** | Unified Humanity Manifesto as coherence tuning fork |
| **Prime Radiant Spec** | L0-L5 foundational architecture |
| **Game Architecture** | Implementation-level UX and loops reference |
| **Game Design Principles** | 11 Reality RPG rules |
| **Transformation Engine** | Core synthesis: 5 vectors → 8 domains |
| **Impact Mapping** | Integral Society Blueprint (6 pillars, 45 focus areas) |
| **Module Registry** | LEGO blocks catalog for Planetary OS |
| **Roadmap** | Next phase strategic work |
| **4-Loop Model** | Character Creation, Character Transformation, Genius Monetization, Multiplayer |

### Key Insights Crystallized
- Body path naming unified (removed "Grounding"/"Rooting Down")
- 4-loop model as core game structure
- QoL decimal stages concept (2.3 → 2.7 visible progress in weeks)
- Inner (5 vectors) → Outer (8 domains) transformation engine

### Code Changes
- `domains.ts` — Body path label fix
- `skillTrees.ts` — Body skill tree ID
- `GameDodecahedron.tsx` — Icon variable naming
- `SkillTrees.tsx` — Domain mapping
- `GameHome.tsx` — Alt text fix

## Day 2 — Saturday, Jan 4, 2025 (Alexander's Birthday 🎂)

**Location**: Network School, Forest City, Malaysia
**Time**: ~2pm onwards

### What We Built

| Item | Description |
|------|-------------|
| **Customer Journey Map v3** | With dopamine moments marked at every step |
| **Daily Loop Spec v2** | "My Next Move" — ONE action, dynamically chosen |
| **Gamification Mechanics** | 12 engagement hooks + Retention Flywheel |
| **White-Label Strategy** | Invisible rails, visible storefronts approach |
| **Vector Sequences Template** | Growth path per vector (for Alexander to fill) |
| **Updated Roadmap** | Clear completed/in-progress/next structure |

### Key Decisions Made
- **Not "game"**: Gamified system, but don't label it as a game
- **Three portals, one experience**: Transform / Monetize / Belong → same onboarding
- **Black hole, not a brand**: Invisible infrastructure, visible communities
- **No emperor, thriving for all**: Value flows to all participants
- **Build ONE first**: MVP for one community, then extract theme layer

### Strategic Insights Crystallized
- **Content is covered**: World-class integral microlearning already exists
- **Life actions covered**: ZoG → monetization → matchmaking is enough to retain
- **Retention flywheel**: Gamification + Rabbit holes + Monetization + Social
- **Cross-community network effects**: Matchmaking across all communities

### Design Patterns Established
- First-person language ("Me", "My Life", "My Next Move")
- ONE recommended action (no choice paralysis)
- Dopamine moments designed into every transition
- Freedom mode via "Explore more →"
- All actions award XP to relevant vector
