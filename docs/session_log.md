| **Prime Radiant Spec** | L0-L5 foundational architecture |
| **Game Architecture** | Implementation-level UX and loops reference |
| **Game Design Principles** | 11 Reality RPG rules |
| **Transformation Engine** | Core synthesis: 5 vectors → 8 domains |

### Key Insights Crystallized

## Day 2 — Saturday, Jan 4, 2025 (Alexander's Birthday 🎂)

**Location**: Network School, Forest City, Malaysia
**Time**: ~2pm onwards

### What We Built

| Item | Description |
|------|-------------|
| **Customer Journey Map v2** | Complete rewrite: 3 entry portals, unified onboarding, first-person framing |
| **Daily Loop Spec v2** | "My Next Move" design — ONE action, dynamically chosen |
| **Clarified Terminology** | "Me", "My Life", "My Next Move" (not "Your World") |
| **6 Action Types** | Practice, Profile Step, Microlearning, Life Action, Monetization Step, Connection |

### Key Decisions Made
- **Not "game"**: Gamified system, but don't label it as a game
- **Three portals, one experience**: Transform / Monetize / Belong all lead to same onboarding
- **Unified onboarding**: ZoG (5 min) → QoL (5 min) → Freedom to explore
- **QoL is Profile**: Part of the person's data, not game data
- **One Profile**: All info in one place, shareable with permission

### Design Patterns Established
- First-person language throughout
- ONE recommended action (no choice paralysis)
- Freedom mode via "Explore more →"
- All actions award XP to relevant vector
- Open-world game feel (guided but not forced)
