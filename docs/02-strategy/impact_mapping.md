# Holonic Impact Mapping

> The Integral Society Blueprint — Foundation of the Mission Discovery Tool

*This is the original architecture that inspired the Planetary OS. It maps all of humanity's impact potential into a navigable, holonic structure.*

---

## The Architecture

The Integral Society Blueprint organizes planetary impact as nested holons, from broad pillars down to specific projects:

```
intégralOS
    ↓
6 Pillars
    ↓
45 Focus Areas
    ↓
~140 Key Challenges
    ↓
~330 Development Goals (2035 targets)
    ↓
~1000 Missions
    ↓
~4000 Impact Projects
```

Each layer contains the next. Each mission belongs to a goal, which addresses a challenge, within a focus area, under a pillar. This creates both **top-down coherence** and **bottom-up emergence**.

## How the Mission Discovery Tool Uses This

The Mission Discovery Tool lets users:

1. **Select a Pillar** — What domain calls to me?
2. **Choose a Focus Area** — Where specifically?
3. **Explore Challenges** — What problem resonates?
4. **Pick a Goal** — What 2035 outcome do I want to contribute to?
5. **Find a Mission** — What specific work can I do?
6. **Join Projects** — Who's already doing this?

At each level, the user narrows their focus until they find missions that align with their Unique Gift.

*(The concentric circle diagram shows how 6 pillars expand through focus areas → challenges → outcomes → missions → projects)*

## Why This Matters

Most impact work is **fragmented**:
- Same problems solved by 100 different orgs in isolation
- No shared map of what exists
- No way to find your place in the whole

This architecture provides:
- **Coherence** — Everyone working from the same map
- **Discovery** — Find where you fit
- **Connection** — Link with others on the same mission
- **Synergy** — Avoid duplication, find complementarity

## Status

| Layer | Count | Data Status |
|-------|-------|-------------|
| Pillars | 6 | ✅ Complete |
| Focus Areas | 45 | ✅ Complete |
| Key Challenges | ~140 | 🟡 In development |
| Development Goals | ~330 | 🟡 In development |
| Missions | ~1000 | 🟡 In development |
| Impact Projects | ~4000 | 🔵 Future (map existing projects) |

---

## Next Steps

1. Finalize challenges and goals for each focus area
2. Populate missions with actionable descriptions
3. Create Telegram/Discord chats for each mission
4. Build project database linked to missions
5. Integrate with Member Portal profile (chosen missions)
