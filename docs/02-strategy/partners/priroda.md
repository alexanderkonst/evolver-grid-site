## Alignment with Evolver

| Their Need | Evolver Solution |
|------------|------------------|
| Onboarding system ("Academy of Continuous Development") | ZoG → QoL → First Practice flow |
| Matching by complementary skills | Discover Space with genius matching |
| Business environment for entrepreneurs | Marketplace + Genius Business |
| Community platform | Evolver as white-label platform |

## Key Insights for Platform

### 1. Content Must Align with Values
> "If system recommends content we haven't experienced ourselves, we can't take responsibility for results."

**Implication:** Need ability to curate/approve recommended practices per community.

### 2. Methodology Transparency Required
> "Based on what science? What psychological school?"

**Implication:** Document the foundations (Integral Theory, etc.) in platform.

### 3. Russian Localization is Critical
Valentin struggled with specialized terminology even with translation.

**Implication:** Priority on i18n implementation.

## The Playbook Moment

During the call, you explained the meta-workflow/Playbook concept:

> "I collapsed the entire product creation process into one button. Given a transformational result (Point A → Point B), AI can iteratively build the entire product."

Valentin recognized this maps to his work: "Architect of Coherent Worlds" — bridging metaphysical vision to functional systems.
