## Executive Summary

> **Thesis**: *"Planetary OS is the coordination layer for the Evolutionary Avantgarde. One launch sequence across all movements — Sovereignty, Innovation, Regeneration, Awakening, Rooting, Creation. People articulate and monetize their value, jump-start collaborations systematically, and the scattered movements building the future coordinate as one meta-ecosystem."*
