## How to Use This Playbook

### AI-Assisted Workflow

1. **Brief AI** — Record a voicenote, share whatever seems important
2. **Upload this playbook** — Prime AI about lean venture-building
3. **Iterate with roasting:**
   - "Please roast this result, no mercy."
   - "Please produce the next version."
   - Repeat until AI oversimplifies
4. **When stuck:** "What question should we ask ourselves to unlock the optimal next step?"

## Part I: PMF Hypothesis Formula

### The Extended Formula

```
🌟 If A experiencing E had C, they'd have no more B and get D. 🌟
```

| Variable | Meaning | Example |
|----------|---------|---------|
| **A** | One specific person in concrete life situation | "Purpose coach with 3 years experience" |
| **B** | Highest frustration (important, urgent, known to them) | "Can't articulate their unique method" |
| **C** | Absurdly simple solution (one step, one outcome) | "Genius articulation session" |
| **D** | Dream outcome | "Clients come because they GET what you do" |
| **E** | Inner voice in moment of desperation | "I'm supposed to be the expert but I can't explain my own approach" |

### Discovery Sequence

```
A → B → C (never backwards!)
```

**Most common mistake:** Working on C before A&B are absurdly simple.

## Part II: Step-by-Step PMF Discovery

### Step 1: Write Your Hypotheses

Write down your best current hypotheses using the PMF formula.

> ⚠️ **Rookie mistake:** Keeping hypotheses in your head instead of written words. This is psychological defense mechanism avoiding confrontation with real world.

### Step 2: Prioritize

Score each hypothesis 1-10 on:
1. **Urgency** — How pressing is this now?
2. **Importance** — How significant if solved?
3. **Problem Awareness** — Do they know they have this problem?

Use simple table: `| Hypothesis | Urgency | Importance | Awareness | Total |`

### Step 3: Track Changes

Keep older versions of each hypothesis. Evolution is the point.

### Step 4: Improve with AI + Critical Thinking

Iterate until you **can't wait** to go validate and sell.

### Step 5: Problem Interviews

Reach out to potential clients. Interview until initial confusion clears.

### Step 6: Lean Solution

Once pain is validated → create leanest possible solution that alleviates maximum pain.

### Step 7: Low-Fidelity Prototype

1. User journey map
2. Screen-by-screen mockup

### Step 8: Pick Business Model & Pricing

(You can change it later)

### Step 9: Solution Interviews → SELL

Sales is ultimate PMF signal.

### Step 10: You Have a Seed

Product mockup that sells + growing clients = investors want to talk.

## Part III: Common Mistakes

| Mistake | Why It Fails |
|---------|--------------|
| Working on C before A&B | Solution without grounded pain |
| No clarity on A before B | Fuzzy target, scattered energy |
| Believing C is shortest path | It's actually the longest |
| Vague definitions | No rigor → no PMF |

## Part IV: AI Button Prompts

### 🎯 1. "Write My PMF Hypothesis"

```
Based on what I share, help me write a PMF hypothesis using this format:
"If A experiencing E had C, they'd have no more B and get D."
Ask clarifying questions if needed before attempting a first version.
```

### 🧪 2. "Prioritize My Ideas"

```
I will share 3–5 ideas. Help me score them on:
- Urgency
- Importance
- Problem Awareness
Return a table sorted by highest combined score.
```

### 🔍 3. "Improve My Hypothesis"

```
Here's my current PMF hypothesis. Please roast it — no mercy.
Then, suggest a refined version. Prioritize clarity, specificity, and emotional punch.
```

### 🎙️ 4. "Create Problem Interview Questions"

```
Help me generate 5–7 powerful questions I can use in a problem interview 
to validate the pain (B) and context (A) in my PMF hypothesis.
```

### 🧰 5. "Prototype Prompt Generator"

```
Based on this PMF hypothesis, generate:
- A quick user journey
- A screen-by-screen low-fidelity mockup idea
Keep it lean and clear.
```

### 🧾 6. "Create My Sales Script"

```
Based on this PMF hypothesis, write a lean, emotionally-resonant pitch script:
- Pain hook
- Outcome promise
- Simple CTA
```

### 🔁 7. "Track My Hypothesis Iterations"

```
I want to track how my PMF hypothesis evolves over time.
Version this one and show changes clearly.
Store each version with timestamp and brief comment on what shifted.
```

## Part V: Competitive Analysis Prompt

```
Here is a website of a company (attached is the pdf of their website). 
Please analyze this and synthesize into an absurdly simple one sentence 
PMF hypothesis they are essentially following. 

The formula is: if <type of person in a type of a situation> had a 
<way out of the pain>, they'd finally have no more <painful situation 
they are aware of, and are actively looking for a way out of>.
```

## The Masterkey (Summary)

> 💡 **Acceleration of iterative improvement of your PMF hypotheses.**

Iterate faster and faster until you validate a real, urgent, important pain that is known to your clients. Then laser-focus and enter the problem space like knife through butter.
