## PMF Hypothesis (One-Sentence Distillation)

```
If [A] had [B], they'd have no more [C].

A = one specific person in a clear situation
B = absurdly simple solution in plain words  
C = painful thing they already feel, described how they'd say it
```

> *Formula from [ITFT](../01-vision/integral_transactional_field_theory.md)*

**Your PMF Hypothesis:**

```
If _________________________ had _________________________,
they'd have no more _________________________.
```

## 1. Myth (The Bridge)

Your myth is the deepest claim your work rests on. If this myth were disproven, your entire business would collapse. It connects your unique gift to the world's need.

### Anatomy of a Myth

Every myth that births a legendary business has four parts:

| Part | Function | Apple example |
|------|----------|---------------|
| **Reality claim** | What must be true about the world for your work to be inevitable | *"The people crazy enough to think they can change the world are the ones who actually do."* |
| **Enemy** | The force or status quo your myth opposes — this is what makes it polarizing | *Conventional thinking. Boring technology. The status quo.* |
| **Tribe** | Who recognizes themselves in this myth — not a demographic, a felt identity | *"The crazy ones. The misfits. The rebels. The round pegs in square holes."* |
| **Invitation** | The action or stance your myth asks people to take | *"Think Different."* |

> **The test:** If someone disproves your reality claim, does your entire business collapse? If yes → correct myth. If no → you're stating a preference, not a truth.

### Fill in yours:

**Reality claim:**
> _______________________________________________________________

**Enemy:**
> _______________________________________________________________

**Tribe:**
> _______________________________________________________________

**Invitation:**
> _______________________________________________________________

**Collapse test:** *"If someone proves [opposite of reality claim], my business collapses."* → ✅ / ❌

## 2. Unique Gift

| Element | Your answer |
|---------|-------------|

| **Compound Archetype** (two archetypes fused) | |

## 3. Ideal Client Profile (ICP)

**Recognition filters** — not demographics. Who are they at their core?

| Qualifier | Signal you'd recognize |
|-----------|----------------------|

| | |
| | |
| | |

> *Key insight: Your most important client is yourself. If this doesn't describe YOU, something is off.*

## 4. Life Situation

What concrete circumstances define their life right now?

**The hidden pressure** (what they don't post about):

## 5. Pain (Point A) — 4 Dimensions

Use the [Pain Theory Playbook](../03-playbooks/pain_theory_playbook.md) to slice deep.

| Dimension | What they experience |
|-----------|---------------------|
| **Decision Pressure** — What's pushing them toward change NOW? | |
| **Felt Consequences** — What they experience daily because of this? | |
| **Cost of Inaction** — What happens in 6 months if nothing changes? | |
| **What's Really at Stake** — Beyond the surface? | |

> *The deeper this is, the stronger everything downstream becomes.*

## 6. Self-Language

The **exact phrases** they use to describe their situation. These become your messaging.

- "_______________________________________________________________"
- "_______________________________________________________________"
- "_______________________________________________________________"

---

## 7. Dream Outcome (Point B)

What does life look like when the transformation is complete? Be vivid, credible, visceral. Not a before-and-after ad — a real description someone would recognize as possible.

- _______________________________________________________________

## 8. Transformational Promise

**From:** *"_______________________________________________________________"*

| **Awareness Stage** of ICP (Problem Aware? Solution Aware?) | |
