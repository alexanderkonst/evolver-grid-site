## PMF Hypothesis (One-Sentence Distillation)

```
If [A] had [B], they'd have no more [C].

A = one specific person in a clear situation
B = absurdly simple solution in plain words  
C = painful thing they already feel, described how they'd say it
```

> *Formula from [ITFT](../01-vision/integral_transactional_field_theory.md)*

**Your PMF Hypothesis:**

```
If _________________________ had _________________________,
they'd have no more _________________________.
```

## 1. Myth (The Bridge)

Your myth is the deepest claim your work rests on. If this myth were disproven, your entire business would collapse. It connects your unique gift to the world's need.

> *"There exists a __________ so structurally __________ that __________ IS __________."*

**Your Myth:**

> _______________________________________________________________

**Roast test:** If someone said "that's not true," would your entire business fall apart? If yes → correct myth.

## 2. Unique Gift

| Element | Your answer |
|---------|-------------|
| **Vibrational Key** (one sentence: what you do at your essence) | |

## 3. Ideal Client Profile (ICP)

**Recognition filters** — not demographics. Who are they at their core?

## 4. Life Situation

What concrete circumstances define their life right now?

**The hidden pressure** (what they don't post about):

## 5. Pain (Point A) — 4 Dimensions

Use the [Pain Theory Playbook](../03-playbooks/pain_theory_playbook.md) to slice deep.

| Dimension | What they experience |
|-----------|---------------------|
| **Decision Pressure** — What's pushing them toward change NOW? | |
| **Felt Consequences** — What they experience daily because of this? | |
| **Cost of Inaction** — What happens in 6 months if nothing changes? | |
| **What's Really at Stake** — Beyond the surface? | |

> *The deeper this is, the stronger everything downstream becomes.*

## 6. Self-Language

The **exact phrases** they use to describe their situation. These become your messaging.

- "_______________________________________________________________"
- "_______________________________________________________________"
- "_______________________________________________________________"
- "_______________________________________________________________"

---

## 7. Dream Outcome (Point B)

What does life look like when the transformation is complete? Be vivid, credible, visceral. Not a before-and-after ad — a real description someone would recognize as possible.

- _______________________________________________________________

**From:** *"_______________________________________________________________"*
