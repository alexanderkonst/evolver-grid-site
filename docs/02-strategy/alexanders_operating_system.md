## The Week — Planetary Energy Cycle

> *"There is a cycle of seven planets... trusting that the way this system has been designed by so many ancient civilizations."*

### The Seven-Day Cycle

Each day of the week carries the energy of a planet. This is encoded in the names across languages (French, Spanish, English) and was recognized by most developed ancient civilizations.

| Day | Planet | Energy | Focus |
|-----|--------|--------|-------|
| **Monday** | Moon 🌙 | Imagination | Visioning, creativity, planting seeds, orienting |
| **Tuesday** | Mars ♂️ | Action | Decisive action, getting things done, executing intentions |
| **Wednesday** | Mercury ☿ | Communication | Synthesis, articulation, calls, clarity, writing |
| **Thursday** | Jupiter ♃ | Expansion | Reaping rewards, reciprocity, abundance, receiving |
| **Friday** | Venus ♀️ | Celebration | Sensuality, pleasure, joy, loving celebration |
| **Saturday** | Saturn ♄ | Structure | Housekeeping, reflection, discipline, integration |
| **Sunday** | Sun ☀️ | Renewal | Holy day, gratitude, connection with higher self, completion |

### How to Use This

**It's not about forcing.** It's about noticing:
- Is it true that on Tuesdays you're inclined to get things done?
- Is it true that on Wednesdays you communicate important things?
- Is it true that on Mondays you just want to orient yourself?

**Surf the wave.** The energy is already there. Align with it instead of fighting it.

### Common Pitfalls

- Acting too much on Monday → Burnout before Tuesday
- Skipping Sunday reflection → Missing the completion of the cycle
- Not celebrating on Friday → Depleting without replenishing

### The Cycle Pattern

```
Monday (Seeds) → Tuesday (Action) → Wednesday (Synthesis) 
                        ↓
Sunday (Gratitude) ← Saturday (Order) ← Friday (Celebrate) ← Thursday (Receive)
```

The day is the deepest, most important cycle in human life.

**Within one day:**
- Make effort
- Grow
- Recover
- Synchronize with deeper dimensions (through sleep and dreams)
- Move forward

**The quality of the daily container has a MULTIPLYING EFFECT.**

If the day is well-structured → everything compounds.
If the day is chaotic → everything leaks.

**This is one of the most important levers for achieving large goals.**

## The Ideal Day Structure

### Morning Block: ORIENTATION (6:00 - 9:00)

| Time | Activity | Purpose |
|------|----------|---------|
| 6:00 | Wake naturally | Aligned with circadian rhythm |
| 6:15 | Movement/stretch | Activate body |
| 6:30 | Breathwork/meditation | Activate spirit |
| 7:00 | Coffee + intention | What's the ONE thing? |
| 7:30 | Light review | Check artifacts from previous day |
| 8:00 | **First Sprint begins** | Deep work on priority |

### AM Block: FIRST SPRINT (8:00 - 12:00)

| Phase | Duration | Focus |
|-------|----------|-------|
| Planning | 15-30 min | Scope clarity, task definition |
| Deep Work 1 | 60-90 min | Main creative work |
| Micro-break | 10-15 min | Movement, water, no screens |
| Deep Work 2 | 60-90 min | Continue or secondary task |
| Close | 15 min | Document what was done, log artifacts |

**Rule:** No meetings, no calls, no interruptions. Phone on airplane mode.

## Deep Work Principles — The Sacred Container

> *"One distraction = a drop of tar in a barrel of honey. It ruins everything."*

### The Non-Negotiables

1. **Zero Distractions**
   - If there's ANY distraction, it's NOT deep work
   - Phone: airplane mode or in another room
   - Browser: only tabs for current task
   - Notifications: ALL OFF
   
2. **Task Formulation First**
   - Before starting: define the ONE THING
   - Write it down explicitly
   - "For this sprint, I am completing: _______"
   - If you can't write it, you're not ready

3. **The Container is Sacred**
   - Ceremony helps: candles, minerals, music
   - Physical space matters
   - Energy alignment (altar, intention)

### Integration = No Screens

> *"During integration breaks, you are the 5th element moving among the 4 elements."*

**What integration looks like:**
- Walking (movement)
- Nature (earth, water, air, fire/sun)
- NO screens
- NO problem-solving
- NO inputs
- Just being and moving

**What integration is NOT:**
- Checking phone "quickly"
- Social media scroll
- Reading articles
- YouTube videos

**The subconscious does the work during integration. Let it.**

---

### Midday: INTEGRATION (12:00 - 14:00)

| Activity | Duration | Purpose |
|----------|----------|---------|
| Walk | 30-45 min | Movement, diffuse thinking |
| Lunch | 30-45 min | Nourishment, no screens |
| Rest | Optional | If needed, short nap (20 min max) |

**Key insight:** This break is NOT wasted time — it's incubation. The subconscious processes what was created in the morning.

### PM Block: SECOND SPRINT (14:00 - 18:00)

| Phase | Duration | Focus |
|-------|----------|-------|
| Orientation | 15 min | Review morning output, set PM scope |
| Deep Work 3 | 60-90 min | Polish, refine, or secondary work |
| Communication | 30-60 min | Messages, meetings (if needed) |
| Deep Work 4 | 60 min | Final push or synthesis |
| Close | 15 min | Document, commit, prepare tomorrow |

**Note:** PM block is for polishing, communicating, synthesizing. AM block is for creation.

### Evening: CLOSE (18:00 - 22:00)

| Activity | Duration | Purpose |
|----------|----------|---------|
| Exercise | 30-60 min | Physical integration |
| Dinner | Food, social connection |
| Light work | Optional | Light reading, reflection, planning |
| Wind-down | 30-60 min | No screens, prepare for sleep |
| Sleep | 22:00-23:00 | Target 7-8 hours |

## Energy Principles

### When to Push

- Morning (8-12): Maximum cognitive capacity
- After breaks: Fresh energy available
- When in flow: Ride the wave

### When to Rest

- Trough after 90 min: Mandatory micro-break
- After lunch: Light work only
- When stuck: Walk, don't force

### When NOT to Work

- Within 1 hour of sleep: No screens, no problem-solving
- When depleted: Rest is investment, not weakness
- When scattered: Pause, re-orient, then resume

## Learnings from January 2026 Incubator

### What Works

1. **Deep work blocks protected** — No meetings before 12:00
2. **AI pair programming** — 10x output when working with Claude/Antigravity
3. **Document everything** — Artifacts compound; memory doesn't
4. **Ship daily** — Momentum beats perfection
5. **Integration breaks** — Walks yield insights

### What Doesn't Work

1. **Pushing through exhaustion** — Quality drops, debt accrues
2. **Scattered sessions** — Context switching kills depth
3. **No evening wind-down** — Sleep quality suffers
4. **Skipping movement** — Body affects mind

### Key Metrics

| Metric | Target | Purpose |
|--------|--------|---------|
| Deep work hours | 6-8 per day | Core output |
| Artifacts created | 1-3 per day | Tangible progress |
| Movement | 30+ min | Energy maintenance |
| Sleep | 7-8 hours | Recovery |

## The Day as Holonic Fractal

The day mirrors all other cycles:

```
ORIENTATION → CREATION → INTEGRATION → REFINEMENT → CLOSE
     ↑                                                  |
     └──────────────────────────────────────────────────┘
```

This pattern appears at every scale:
- **Hour:** Intention → Work → Rest
- **Half-day:** Planning → Sprint → Break
- **Day:** Morning → Afternoon → Evening
- **Week:** Monday vision → Midweek execution → Friday close
- **Month:** Week 1 planning → Weeks 2-3 building → Week 4 shipping
