# ORIGINAL ROADMAP ITEMS (Preserved)

---

## 📦 PRODUCT / MODULES

### Module Landings (Priority: HIGH | Target: This Week)
**Idea #1:** Landing pages for every module!

Every module in the system gets its own landing page that explains:
- What the module does
- Transformational result
- How to use it
- How to co-create it

**Status:** Queued

---

### Module Versioning (Priority: HIGH | Target: This Week)
**Idea #3:** Version the whole thing! Every module, every piece of documentation.

Create an underlying versioning scheme:
- Module versions (v1.0, v1.1, v2.0)
- Documentation versions
- Changelog per module

**Status:** Will be added when creating module landings

---

### User Artifact Versioning (Priority: HIGH | Target: This Week)  
**Idea #4:** Version each person's artifacts.

Track evolution of user-generated content:
- Unique Gift v1.0, v1.1...
- Unique Business v1.0, v1.1...
- Landing Page v1.0, v1.1...
- Distribution Strategy v1.0...
- Mission v1.0...
- Assets v1.0...

Creates feeling of progress and evolution. "Your Unique Gift has evolved 3 times!"

**Status:** Part of module versioning scope

---

### Holonic Page Navigation (Priority: MEDIUM | Target: This Week)
**Idea #8:** How to show and navigate the holonic pages?

Visual representation of nested module structure:
- Zoomable hierarchy
- Breadcrumb navigation
- Module relationships

**Status:** 🔄 Design exploration needed

---

### Unique Business Iteration Flow (Priority: HIGH | Target: February)
**Idea #9:** After first Unique Business iteration, prompt for improvement.

When user sees their first Unique Business version:
1. Ask: "Want to improve any aspects? Create next iteration?"
2. Show dropdown/buttons: ICP, Transformational Promise, Methodology, etc.
3. On selection → show quality prompts (e.g., for ICP: "Describe yourself, what subcultures, who do you really speak same language with?")
4. AI generates improved version

**Key insight:** User refines iteratively, each cycle improves their business.

**Status:** February scope - after core flow works

---

### Smart Packaging Recommendations (Priority: HIGH | Target: February)
**Idea #10:** Recommend 2-3 packaging formats based on Unique Business type.

Different business types need different formats:
- From books to SaaS products
- Methodologies, playlists, 1-on-1 sessions, substacks, etc.

The system will:
1. Analyze user's Unique Business
2. Recommend 2-3 best-fit formats
3. Explain WHY each format matches their business
4. Start simple, grow complexity

**Status:** February scope - after Unique Business flow works

---

### Community Leader Dashboard (Priority: MEDIUM | Target: February)
**Idea #11:** Admin view for community leaders.

Leaders can see in one place:
- All community resources
- Member stats
- Event management
- Aggregate patterns
- Branding controls

**Status:** February scope - after core platform stable

---

## 📣 MARKETING & GROWTH

### Invite System (Priority: MEDIUM | Target: February)
**Idea #2:** Invite people to every module — to use, to co-create, to meet others working on this.

Every module can be:
- Used individually
- Co-created (contribute improvements)
- Social space (meet other users of this module)

**Status:** February scope

---

### Doubling Invites / Waitlist (Priority: MEDIUM | Target: February)
**Idea #5:** Invite users in doubling batches.

Growth strategy:
1. First 2 invites
2. First 5 invites
3. First 10 invites
4. First 100 invites
5. First 500 invites
6. Waitlist for the rest

Build a tool for this. Karime as second user.

**Status:** February - Growth hacking scope

---

### Autonomous Agent Invites (Priority: HIGH | Target: March)
**Idea #6:** Platform invites as a living organism.

The platform will reach out using agents:
- First invites are manual (Alexander)
- Then OS does the invites autonomously
- AI agents identify and reach potential users

**Status:** March - Autonomous growth scope

---

## 🎨 DESIGN / UX

### Fast Design Workflow (Priority: HIGH | Target: Today/Tomorrow)
**Idea #7:** How to make & develop design for the OS fast?

Initial ideas:
- Screenshots → send to AI → get improvements

- Harmonize (layout, sizes)
- Minimalism as principle
- Types of pages catalog

**Status:** 🎯 Active

---

# NEW ITEMS (Added Feb 9, 2026)

---

## 🎨 BRAND & CONTENT

### Logos (Priority: HIGH | Target: This Cycle)
**What:** Platform logo + per-module logos. Brand identity at every touchpoint.
**Why:** Premium perception. Shareability. Recognition.
**Status:** 🔜 Queued

---

### Videos (Priority: HIGH | Target: This Cycle)
**What:** Explainer videos, onboarding walkthroughs, per-module intros.
**Why:** Reduces friction. Increases activation. Content for distribution.
**Status:** 🔜 Queued

---

## 📚 LEARN SPACE

### Experiential Modules for Learn Space (Priority: MEDIUM)
**What:** Suggestions for experiential, embodied modules within Learn space. Not just content consumption — practices, rituals, micro-transformations.
**Why:** Learn space needs to deliver felt experience, not just information.
**Status:** 🔜 Ideation

---

## 🌐 LANDING PAGES

### Holonic Landing Pages Per Module (Priority: MEDIUM)
**What:** Every module gets its own resonant landing page — explaining result, inviting participation, showing social proof.
**Why:** Each module is a holon. Each holon deserves its own entry point for distribution and virality.
**Status:** 🔜 Queued (extends existing item 4.3)

---

## 🌙 OPERATING SYSTEM

### Alexander's Operating System Cycles (Priority: MEDIUM)
**What:** Encode moon cycles, planetary day cycles, ultradian rhythm (96-min deep work containers) into the platform's scheduling/recommendation engine.
**Why:** The OS should model reality's rhythms, not just arbitrary calendars. Alexander already operates this way — platform should reflect it.
**Status:** ✅ v1 DONE (Equilibrium) — see below for v2 refinement

---

### Equilibrium v2: Conceptual Refinement (Priority: HIGH | Target: Next Cycle)
**What:** Re-run the integrated product building playbook on the existing Equilibrium clock. The v1 was built end-to-end but the **Master Result and Sub-Results weren't deeply roasted**, causing fuzzy information hierarchy. The tech works — the concept needs sharpening.

**Key issues to resolve:**
1. **Master Result clarity** — "Cycle-aware deep work" is aspirational-vague. Needs a 12-year-old-understandable version.
2. **Information hierarchy** — 6 rings + 4 phases + moon + planetary hours + synthesis + guidance = too much. What's the ONE thing a user sees in 3 seconds?
3. **Phase naming** — Now uses PLANNING/BUILDING/COMMUNICATING/INTEGRATING (done, was WILL/EMANATION etc.)
4. **Clean watch face** — Ring labels removed (done). But the bottom text area still has overlapping concerns.

**Approach:** Re-run Phase 1 only (with new roast structure: 3×3 on Master Result + Sub-Results). Then see which existing code survives. Don't rebuild from scratch — refine the concept, reshape the UI.

**What's already working (keep):**
- Cycle math (cycles.ts) — all calculations correct
- Sprint timer with 4-phase structure
- Breathing circle animation
- Planetary day/hour system
- Moon phase tracking
- Settings panel with personalization

**Status:** 🔜 Queued for next cycle

---

## 📋 PLAYBOOK IMPROVEMENTS

### Integrated Product Building Workflow — Roast Enhancement (Priority: ✅ DONE)
**What:** Added roast cycles after every Phase 1 task. Tasks 1.1 (Master Result) and 1.2 (Sub-Results) get deep 3×3 roasts (9 checks each). Tasks 1.3-1.6 get lighter roasts.
**Why:** The Equilibrium build proved that fuzzy foundations trickle down into fuzzy products. The first two tasks define WHAT you're building — they deserve the most scrutiny.
**Status:** ✅ DONE (2026-02-10)

---

## 🤖 AI

### AI Ideas & Revenue (Priority: HIGH)
**What:** Three-pronged AI strategy:
1. **Implementation** — AI-powered features within the platform (already in progress)
2. **Market research** — What do people actually want and need from AI assistance?
3. **AI workshops** — Sell AI collaboration training as a standalone revenue stream

**Why:** Immediate revenue opportunity. Alexander has unique AI-human collaboration expertise. Workshops fund platform development.
**Status:** 🔜 Active ideation
