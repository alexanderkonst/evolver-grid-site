# Collaboration Spectrum
## 11 Stages of Holonic Collaboration Readiness/Evolution

> *"From fortress to mycelium — the evolutionary path of how humans work together."*

*Co-created with AI using integrative approaches*

## The Spectrum

| Stage | Essence | Description |
|-------|---------|-------------|
| **1** | **Holding Fortress** | Operating in isolation, guarding knowledge, avoiding "competitors" |
| **2** | **Random Conversations** | Casual conversations begin, trust starts to glimmer |
| **3** | **Exchanges** | Swapping tools, ideas, best practices — open-source curiosity |
| **4** | **Collabs** | One-off shared projects with aligned allies; revenue-shared but compartmental |
| **5** | **Partnerships** | Ongoing duo collaborations with shared vision and operational rhythm |
| **6** | **Gigs** | Multi-party one-off gatherings: summits, hackathons, curated events |
| **7** | **Teams** | Recurring co-creation among diverse players: trust, roles, ritual |
| **8** | **Swarms** | Living ecosystem of teams, flexibly interwoven like DAO, studio, or hive |
| **9** | **Holonic Ecosystems** | Holonic teams plugging into planetary lattice — fluid, sovereign, synergistic |
| **10** | **Mycelium Symbiosis** | Silent symphony: real-time weaving, co-evolving with AI, Earth, Source |
| **11** | **...** | Beyond current vision — emergent |

## Diagnostic Questions

### Where Are You Now?

| If you... | You're likely at Stage... |
|-----------|--------------------------|
| Work alone, protect IP, see others as competition | 1 (Fortress) |
| Have conversations but no shared projects | 2-3 (Conversations/Exchanges) |
| Do occasional projects together, split revenue | 4 (Collabs) |
| Have ongoing partner(s) with shared rhythm | 5 (Partnerships) |
| Organize or participate in multi-party events | 6 (Gigs) |
| Part of recurring team with defined roles | 7 (Teams) |
| Fluid between multiple interwoven projects | 8 (Swarms) |
| Work feels like plugging into larger organism | 9 (Holonic) |
| Co-create with non-human intelligence (AI, nature) | 10 (Mycelium) |

## Stage Transitions

### What Unlocks Each Next Stage?

| From → To | Key Unlock |
|-----------|------------|
| 1 → 2 | Risk one vulnerable conversation |
| 2 → 3 | Share something valuable without expecting return |
| 3 → 4 | Propose a project with aligned revenue share |
| 4 → 5 | Commit to ongoing rhythm (weekly, monthly) |
| 5 → 6 | Invite others into temporary orchestration |
| 6 → 7 | Establish recurring rituals and defined roles |
| 7 → 8 | Allow fluid membership, release fixed structure |
| 8 → 9 | Connect your swarm to larger network/lattice |
| 9 → 10 | Include non-human intelligences as partners |

## Platform Implications

### Matchmaking by Stage

Users at similar stages collaborate most easily.
Users 1-2 stages apart can mentor/be mentored.
Users 3+ stages apart may struggle without bridge.

### Feature Mapping

| Stage | Platform Feature |
|-------|------------------|
| 2-3 | Discovery, profile viewing, DMs |
| 4 | Project proposals, revenue split tools |
| 5 | Partnership dashboard, shared goals |
| 6 | Event creation, temporary team formation |
| 7 | Team spaces, role assignment, rituals |
| 8 | Swarm coordination, fluid membership |
| 9 | Cross-platform integration, planetary network |
| 10 | AI collaboration, nature-sync features |
