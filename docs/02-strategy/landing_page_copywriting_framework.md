## The Flow

```
Target Audience → Problem → Solution → Offer
                    ↓
         Customer Forces Analysis
   (Push / Pull / Anxiety / Inertia / Enemy)
                    ↓
            3 Angle Options
            (user picks best)
                    ↓
         Final Landing Page
```

## Phase 1: Inputs

| Field | Description | Example |
|-------|-------------|---------|
| **Target Audience** | Who exactly | "Purpose coaches" |
| **Problem** | As formulated | "Becoming outcompeted due to lack of specialization" |
| **Solution** | What you offer | "Define, articulate, apply, monetize your Unique Gift" |
| **Offer** | Value ladder | "Free definition → Paid system → 1:1 journey" |

---

## Phase 2: Customer Forces Analysis

This is the SECRET SAUCE — more nuanced than simple Pain/Solution.

### PUSH (Pain Points)
What's pushing them AWAY from status quo?
- External pressures they're experiencing daily
- What's NOT working anymore
- The quiet dread they don't talk about

**Example:**
> "They're watching their offers blend into a sea of 'purpose + mindset' messaging, and discovery calls increasingly end with prospects saying they're also talking to a more well-known coach..."

### PULL (Benefits)
What's pulling them TOWARD the solution?
- The dream outcome
- What they're drawn to
- The promise they can't ignore

**Example:**
> "They're drawn to a clear 'Unique Gift' definition that finally names the thing they do that others can't replicate..."

### ANXIETY (Concerns)
What stops them from buying?
- Fears about the solution
- Past failures with similar things
- Identity concerns

**Example:**
> "They worry that narrowing into a specialization will box them in, alienate existing clients...They're skeptical because they've bought branding programs before that produced pretty words but didn't materially increase conversions..."

### INERTIA (Habit)
What keeps them stuck in current behavior?
- Default behaviors that feel safe
- Sunk costs
- Familiar moves that work "well enough"

**Example:**
> "They default to broad, flexible positioning because it keeps options open...Sunk costs in their current website copy, certification language..."

### ENEMY
The status quo or force to fight against.

## Phase 3: Angle Generation

Generate 3 OPTIONS with different angles:

### Angle Types:
1. **Pain-Lead**: Start with the specific pain
2. **Benefit-Lead**: Start with the outcome
3. **Enemy-Lead**: Start with what's wrong with status quo

### Each Angle Has:
- **Headline** (8-15 words, sharp positioning)
- **Body** (2-3 sentences expanding the angle)
- **CTA** (specific action + what they get)

**Example Options:**
> **Option 1 (Pain-Lead):** "Stop being the 'generic purpose coach' clients scroll past..."
> **Option 2 (Benefit-Lead):** "Become unmistakably positioned: define, articulate, apply, and monetize..."
> **Option 3 (Enemy-Lead):** "Content won't save you: specialization is the real growth lever..."

User picks best angle or refreshes.

## Phase 4: Final Landing Page Structure

### Template: Product-Led (Hero / Screenshots / Problem / Solution)

```
FOR [AUDIENCE]
[HEADLINE] - "Become the purpose coach clients remember"
[SUBHEADLINE] - Define and monetize... without relying on fame or constant posting.

[CTA BUTTON] - Get the Unique Business Blueprint

WHEN YOUR WORK SOUNDS LIKE EVERYONE ELSE'S
• Pain point 1 (with consequence)
• Pain point 2 (with consequence)
• Pain point 3 (with consequence)
• Pain point 4 (with consequence)

A CLEAR SYSTEM TO [SOLUTION]
✓ Step 1: Define...
✓ Step 2: Articulate...
✓ Step 3: Turn into...
✓ Step 4: Apply...
✓ Step 5: Monetize...

[FINAL CTA SECTION]
[Headline] - Stop blending in. Build your unique business.
[Subhead] - Get the blueprint to...
[Email input]
[Button] - Send Me the Blueprint
```

## Key Insights

1. **Angles** = Multiple positioning options before committing
2. **Customer Forces** = 4-part analysis (not just Pain/Solution)
3. **Anxiety handling** = Address objections BEFORE they come up
4. **Inertia breaking** = Show why current approach isn't working
5. **Enemy framing** = Give them something to fight against

---

## Implementation for Product Builder

### Option A: Quick (for today)
- Update `generate-landing` prompt to use Customer Forces
- Generate 1 best angle (no user choice)

### Option B: Full (future)
- Add Customer Forces generation step
- Show 3 angles, let user pick
- Generate final landing from chosen angle
