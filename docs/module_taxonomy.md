## 🔔 My Next Move Logic (FINAL)

### The Sequence

```
1. GROW → Profile completion first
   └── ZoG → QoL → Resources → Mission

2. LEARN → Ongoing forever (default rabbit hole)
   └── Library → Growth Paths → Skill Trees

3. One-time nudges:
   ├── Resources done → nudge COLLABORATE
   └── ZoG done → nudge BUILD (badge on icon)
```

### What's NOT in My Next Move

| Space | Why Not |
|-------|---------|
| **MEET** | User discovers events naturally |
| **BUY & SELL** | User browses anytime |
| **BUILD** (ongoing) | One-time nudge only |

### Badge System

🔓 Badge on space icon when something unlocks → user clicks → badge disappears
