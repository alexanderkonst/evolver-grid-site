## 🎯 The Gap We Solved

**Morning:** People discover their genius (10/10 resonance) but can't monetize it.
**Evening:** One-button Product Builder that compiles genius into published marketplace products.

## 🚀 What We Built (0→1)

### Product Builder Module — 8-Screen Wizard

| Screen | What Happens |
|--------|--------------|
| 1. Entry | "Build Your Product in 15 min" promise |
| 2. Deep ICP | AI enriches ideal client using Pain Theory |
| 3. Deep Pain | Maps Pressure, Consequences, Cost, Stakes |
| 4. Deep TP | Point A → Point B crystallization |
| 5. Landing Page | Full landing with Customer Forces framework |
| 6. Blueprint | Lead magnet generation |
| 7. CTA | Session vs Software choice |
| 8. Published | 🎉 Confetti + marketplace link |

**Flow:** Excalibur → Product Builder → /mp/:slug (live product)

## ⚡ The Meta-Insight: AI-Assisted Development

```
Estimated: 32 hours
Actual: ~30 minutes
= AI-assisted development
```

**Formula:**
```
Human Vision + AI Speed + Pre-planned Design = significantly faster
```

## 🧠 New Frameworks Created

### 1. Pain Theory Playbook
- Pressure (external forces)
- Consequences (daily experience)
- Cost of Inaction (price of staying)
- Stakes (what's really at risk)

### 2. Customer Forces Framework
- Push (pain driving change)
- Pull (benefits attracting)
- Anxiety (what stops buying)
- Inertia (what keeps them stuck)

### 3. Monetization Evolution Ladder
Body → Mind → Soul → Spirit → Being
(Product complexity progression)
