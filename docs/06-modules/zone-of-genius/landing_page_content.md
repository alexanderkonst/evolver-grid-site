## STEP 2: MARKETING LAYER

### 2.0 Core Belief

```
We believe that every person has a Zone of Genius — a specific configuration of talents 
that makes them irreplaceably valuable. The problem isn't a lack of genius. 
The problem is that most people have never had it named.
```

### 2.1 Packaging

| Field | Value |
|-------|-------|
| **Price** | Free (assessment + PDF snapshot) |
| **Format** | AI-powered self-assessment (4 steps, ~20 minutes) |
| **Value ladder position** | Entry point — main acquisition funnel |
| **What they get for free** | Full assessment, named archetype, 12-perspective PDF snapshot |
| **What's behind paywall** | Career Re-Ignition Session ($297) — live 90-min with Aleksandr |

### 2.2 Frictionless Purchase

| Field | Value |
|-------|-------|
| **CTA action** | Start free assessment (no account required initially) |
| **One-click ready?** | Yes — one button to start, no signup wall |
| **Objections pre-answered** | (1) "Is this another personality quiz?" → No, it uses a proprietary 81-talent taxonomy. (2) "How long does it take?" → ~20 minutes. (3) "Will it actually be useful?" → You get a named archetype + PDF you can share with employers/clients. |

### 2.3 Core Message Stack

```
1. CORE BELIEF: "We believe every person has a Zone of Genius waiting to be named."

2. ONE-LINER: "Zone of Genius Discovery helps professionals who feel 'successful but off' 
   name the exact work they were built to do — in 20 minutes, for free."

3. RESONANCE HOOK: "For people who've done all the personality tests and still can't 
   explain what makes them different in one sentence."

4. ANTI-MESSAGES:
   - NOT: "Unlock your potential" (vague, overused)
   - NOT: "Find your passion" (they already have skills, not seeking passion)
   - NOT: "Take our quiz!" (this is not a Buzzfeed quiz)
   - NOT: "Transform your life" (too grandiose for a 20-min assessment)
```

### 2.4 Messaging Ladder

```
L1 — HOOK: "You're not lost. You're unnamed."

L2 — RESONANCE: "You've taken the personality tests. You've done the coaching. 
     You know you're good at what you do. But you still can't explain — in one 
     clear sentence — what makes you different."

L3 — PROOF: "Built on a taxonomy of 81 distinct talents. Powered by AI pattern 
     recognition. Created by Aleksandr Konstantinov (MIT, 10+ years, 250+ people guided)."

L4 — ACTION: "Reveal your Zone of Genius — free, 20 minutes, PDF included."
```

### 2.5 ICP Deep Dive

#### 🫀 Heart

| Field | Value |
|-------|-------|
| Deep desire | To be recognized for what they uniquely bring — not just competence, but essence |
| Emotional need | Permission to stop trying to be well-rounded and own their specific brilliance |
| Pain Point A | "I know I'm good, but I can't articulate WHY or at WHAT specifically" |

#### 🧠 Mind

| Field | Value |
|-------|-------|
| Beliefs about the problem | "I should know this about myself by now" / "Maybe I need more experience" |
| Beliefs about solutions | Skeptical of personality tests (done too many). Open to something that goes deeper. |
| Key objections | "How is this different from MBTI/StrengthsFinder?" / "Will this actually change anything?" |
| Awareness stage | 3 (Solution-aware — knows tools exist, hasn't found the right one) |

#### 🔥 Gut

| Field | Value |
|-------|-------|
| Current behavior | Reads articles about career clarity, takes personality tests, asks friends "what am I good at?" |
| Trigger for action | Career transition moment: new job, layoff, mid-career restlessness, "is this all there is?" |
| Barrier to action | Time investment concern, skepticism from past test disappointments |

## STEP 3: CUSTOMER FORCES

### 3.1 PUSH (Away from status quo)

- They're watching peers build clear personal brands while they describe themselves in generic terms
- Job interviews and networking events feel uncomfortable because they can't articulate their value proposition
- They've outgrown their current role but can't name what role they actually want
- The nagging feeling that they're operating at 60% of their capacity but don't know where the other 40% is

### 3.2 PULL (Toward solution)

- A named, specific genius they can say out loud: "I'm The Catalyst — I see what's stuck and unstick it"
- A PDF they can share with a manager, partner, or coach to explain what they bring
- The clarity to finally stop second-guessing career moves
- A framework that goes deeper than MBTI/StrengthsFinder — actual talent taxonomy, not just types

### 3.3 ANXIETY (Stops them from starting)

- "What if it tells me something I don't want to hear?"
- "What if it's too generic to be useful?" (past personality test trauma)
- "What if I don't have a genius — what if I'm just... average?"
- "20 minutes is still time I could spend on something proven"

### 3.4 INERTIA (Keeps them stuck)

- Current generic positioning "works well enough" — they're employed, getting clients
- Sunk cost in existing personal brand language and LinkedIn profile
- The default of describing themselves by job title rather than genius
- Comfort in being a generalist ("I can do anything!") vs. the vulnerability of naming a specific thing

### 3.5 ENEMY

"The enemy is the myth that you need to be well-rounded to succeed — that generic competence is better than specific brilliance."

## STEP 4: LANDING PAGE CONTENT

### 4.1 Hero

| Field | Value |
|-------|-------|

| **Headline** | Name the work you were actually built to do |
| **Subheadline** | Get your free Zone of Genius Snapshot in 20 minutes — without another generic personality test |
| **CTA button text** | Reveal your Zone of Genius |
| **CTA button link** | `/zone-of-genius/entry` |

### 4.2 For Whom

- You've done MBTI, StrengthsFinder, Enneagram — and still can't explain your edge in one sentence
- You're "successful enough" but feel like you're operating on borrowed positioning
- You're in a career transition and need clarity, not another job board
- People tell you "you're so talented" but can't name AT WHAT — and neither can you
- You want to build offers, lead projects, or switch careers from a place of known genius, not guesswork

### 4.3 Pain Section

| Field | Value |
|-------|-------|
| **Section header** | "When you can't name what makes you different" |
| **Pain bullet 1** | You describe yourself by job title instead of genius — so every networking intro sounds like everyone else's |
| **Pain bullet 2** | You've taken personality tests that told you you're "strategic" and "empathetic" — useful as saying you're "human" |
| **Pain bullet 3** | Career decisions feel like guesswork because you don't have a clear filter for "this is my work / this isn't" |
| **Pain bullet 4** | You keep diversifying your skills instead of deepening the one thing that would make you irreplaceable |

### 4.4 Solution Section

| Field | Value |
|-------|-------|
| **Section header** | "A clear path from unnamed to unmistakable" |
| **Step 1** | **Select** your top talents from a taxonomy of 81 — see which ones light up for you |
| **Step 2** | **Narrow** to your core 3 — the talents that define your genius, not just your skills |
| **Step 3** | **Order** them — because the sequence reveals the pattern |
| **Step 4** | **Generate** your Zone of Genius Snapshot — AI reveals your archetype, core pattern, and 12 perspectives on your genius |
| **Step 5** | **Download** your personalized PDF — share it, use it, build from it |

### 4.6 How It Works

| 1 | Select and rank your top talents from 81 options | ~15 min |
| 2 | AI analyzes your unique talent pattern | ~1 min |
| 3 | Receive your Snapshot: archetype, insights, PDF | Instant |

### 4.7 Story/Origin

Built by Aleksandr Konstantinov — MIT alum, 10+ years guiding 250+ people through career transitions. After watching hundreds of talented professionals struggle to name what makes them different, he built the Zone of Genius taxonomy: 81 distinct talents organized into 9 categories. Not a personality type. Not a quiz. A talent map that gives you a name for the work you were built to do.
