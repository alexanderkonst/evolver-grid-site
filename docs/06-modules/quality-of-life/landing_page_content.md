## STEP 1: PRODUCT LAYER

### 1.1 Master Result

```
FROM: "I feel like something's off in my life, but I can't pinpoint what — everything blurs together."
TO:   "I have a clear map of exactly where I stand across 8 life domains, and I know which one to focus on first."
```

### 1.2 Sub-Results

| # | Sub-Result | What user gains |
|---|------------|-----------------|
| 1 | **Domain Awareness** | See that life isn't one blob — it's 8 distinct domains (wealth, health, happiness, love, impact, growth, social ties, home) |
| 2 | **Honest Self-Assessment** | Rate yourself on a 10-stage scale per domain — see where you actually are, not where you think you are |
| 3 | **Visual Map** | See all 8 domains on a radar chart — instantly spot the gaps and strengths |
| 4 | **Priority Selection** | Choose which domain to focus on first — based on what matters most to YOU, not a generic prescription |
| 5 | **Next-Step Guidance** | AI-generated guidance per domain: inner shift (mindset) + outer shift (action) to move to the next stage |

### 1.3 Artifacts

| Artifact | Format | When received |
|----------|--------|---------------|
| Quality of Life Map (radar chart) | On-screen visualization | After assessment |
| Domain-by-domain stage breakdown | On-screen + saved to profile | After assessment |

## STEP 2: MARKETING LAYER

### 2.0 Core Belief

```
We believe that you can't improve what you can't see. Most people know something's off 
in their life but can't name WHAT — because they've never had a framework to separate 
the 8 domains that make up a life. Clarity precedes change.
```

### 2.1 Packaging

| Field | Value |
|-------|-------|
| **Price** | Free |
| **Format** | Integral assessment framework (~10 minutes) |
| **Value ladder position** | Entry point — second acquisition funnel |
| **What they get for free** | Full assessment, radar chart, stage descriptions, AI guidance, PDF export |
| **What's behind paywall** | Nothing — this is a pure acquisition tool. Monetization happens downstream (Growth Paths, Sessions) |

### 2.2 Frictionless Purchase

| Field | Value |
|-------|-------|
| **CTA action** | Start free assessment |
| **One-click ready?** | Yes — no signup required to start |
| **Objections pre-answered** | (1) "I already know what's wrong" → You might be surprised — people consistently misjudge which domains need attention. (2) "Life assessments are too simplistic" → This uses a 10-stage framework per domain, not a 1-10 rating. Each stage has specific criteria. (3) "What do I do with the results?" → AI generates one concrete next step per domain. |

### 2.3 Core Message Stack

```
1. CORE BELIEF: "We believe clarity precedes change — you can't improve what you can't see."

2. ONE-LINER: "Quality of Life Map helps people who feel 'something's off' see exactly 
   where they stand across 8 life domains — in 10 minutes, for free."

3. RESONANCE HOOK: "For people who are doing fine on paper but feel like they're 
   winning in some areas while quietly neglecting others."

4. ANTI-MESSAGES:
   - NOT: "Rate your happiness 1-10" (too simplistic)
   - NOT: "Life coaching assessment" (we're not coaches selling sessions)
   - NOT: "Find out what's wrong with your life" (deficit framing)
   - NOT: "Transform all areas of your life" (unrealistic scope)
```

### 2.4 Messaging Ladder

```
L1 — HOOK: "You know something's off. You just can't name which part."

L2 — RESONANCE: "You're doing well at work but your health slipped. Or your 
     relationships are great but you stopped growing. Life doesn't fail all 
     at once — it fails one domain at a time, quietly."

L3 — PROOF: "An integral framework across 8 life domains. 10 stages per domain — 
     not a vague rating, but specific criteria. AI-generated next steps. 
     Used by 250+ people on the Evolver platform."

L4 — ACTION: "Map your life in 10 minutes — free, visual, actionable."
```

### 2.5 ICP Deep Dive

#### 🫀 Heart

| Field | Value |
|-------|-------|
| Deep desire | To feel like they're living a WHOLE life, not just succeeding in one area while others decay |
| Emotional need | Reassurance that the "off" feeling has a name and a fix — it's not existential crisis, it's domain imbalance |
| Pain Point A | "I feel successful but unfulfilled, and I can't explain why to anyone — including myself" |

#### 🧠 Mind

| Field | Value |
|-------|-------|
| Beliefs about the problem | "I should be happy — I have X, Y, Z" / "Maybe I'm just ungrateful" |
| Beliefs about solutions | Open to self-reflection tools. Skeptical of anything too woo or too corporate. |
| Key objections | "Life is too complex to reduce to 8 categories" / "What will I actually DO with this?" |
| Awareness stage | 2-3 (Problem-aware: knows something's off. May not know frameworks exist for this.) |

#### 🔥 Gut

| Field | Value |
|-------|-------|
| Current behavior | Journaling, therapy, reading self-help, occasional life audits that don't stick |
| Trigger for action | Major life event (birthday, breakup, health scare) or quiet accumulation of "is this it?" |
| Barrier to action | Feels indulgent to "assess your life" when things aren't catastrophic |

## STEP 3: CUSTOMER FORCES

### 3.1 PUSH (Away from status quo)

- The vague sense that they're winning in some areas while silently losing in others
- Friends/family saying "you seem fine" while they feel anything but
- Physical symptoms of imbalance: burnout from overwork, loneliness from neglecting relationships, stagnation from avoiding growth
- The growing gap between their external success metrics and internal life satisfaction

### 3.2 PULL (Toward solution)

- A clear visual map that shows the SHAPE of their life — not a single score, but a multi-dimensional picture
- Specific, named stages for each domain — not just "good/bad" but "here's exactly where you are and what the next level looks like"
- Permission to focus on ONE domain instead of trying to fix everything at once
- AI-generated guidance that's personal, not generic advice from a book

### 3.3 ANXIETY (Stops them from starting)

- "What if the map shows me how bad things really are?" (confrontation anxiety)
- "This feels self-indulgent — shouldn't I just be grateful for what I have?"
- "What if it tells me to change something I'm not ready to change?"
- "Life assessment tools are usually too simplistic to be useful"

### 3.4 INERTIA (Keeps them stuck)

- "Things aren't bad enough to warrant a life assessment"
- Current coping mechanisms (staying busy, focusing on work) mask the imbalance
- The effort of honest self-reflection feels heavier than just continuing
- No framework readily available — if you can't name the domains, you can't assess them

### 3.5 ENEMY

"The enemy is the myth that life is one thing — that you're either 'doing well' or 'not doing well.' Life is 8 things, and most people are thriving in 2-3 while unconsciously neglecting the rest."

### 4.2 For Whom

- You're successful in your career but your health or relationships have quietly slipped
- You journal, reflect, maybe see a therapist — but you still can't name exactly what's off
- You've tried "life audits" before, but they were either too vague or too overwhelming to act on
- You want to focus your energy on the ONE area that will make the biggest difference right now
- You're not in crisis — you're in drift. And you want to steer.

### 4.3 Pain Section

| Field | Value |
|-------|-------|
| **Section header** | "When 'I'm fine' stops being true" |
| **Pain bullet 1** | You're crushing it at work but haven't exercised in months — and the energy debt is showing |
| **Pain bullet 2** | You know your relationships need attention but you keep telling yourself "after this project" |
| **Pain bullet 3** | You set goals every January that cover 3 areas and ignore 5 — because you've never seen all 8 at once |
| **Pain bullet 4** | The "something's off" feeling gets louder each year, but without a map, you can't navigate toward the fix |

### 4.4 Solution Section

| Field | Value |
|-------|-------|
| **Section header** | "From fog to a clear map in 10 minutes" |
| **Step 1** | **Assess** each of 8 life domains on a 10-stage scale — not a gut rating, but specific criteria per stage |
| **Step 2** | **See** your life as a radar chart — instantly spot which domains are strong and which need attention |
| **Step 3** | **Prioritize** — choose which domain to focus on first based on YOUR values, not a generic prescription |
| **Step 4** | **Act** — get AI-generated guidance: one inner shift + one outer shift per domain to reach the next stage |

### 4.5 Outcomes (What you walk away with)

- ✅ A **radar chart** showing all 8 life domains at a glance
- ✅ **Stage descriptions** for each domain — know exactly where you are (e.g., "Wealth Stage 4: Stable income, no investments")
- ✅ **Priority order** — which domain to focus on first, second, third
- ✅ **AI-generated next steps** — one concrete inner shift + one outer shift per domain
- ✅ **PDF export** — save and share your map
- ✅ **Profile integration** — your map is saved and updates when you retake

### 4.6 How It Works

| Step | What happens | Time |
|------|-------------|------|
| 1 | Rate yourself in each of 8 life domains using guided stage descriptions | ~8 min |
| 2 | See your results as a visual radar map with AI-powered insights | Instant |
| 3 | Set priorities and get personalized next-step guidance | ~2 min |

### 4.7 Story/Origin

Most life assessments ask you to rate happiness 1-10 and call it a day. That tells you nothing. The Quality of Life Map uses an integral framework across 8 domains — wealth, health, happiness, love & relationships, impact, growth, social ties, and home — each with 10 specific stages. It was built because we believe you can't improve what you can't see. And most people have never seen their life mapped across all the dimensions that actually matter.
