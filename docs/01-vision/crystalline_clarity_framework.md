## The Core Insight

**Growth → Results**  
Not the other way around.

Results in life (Quality of Life) are the *output* of inner development. You cannot achieve results and then grow into them. You grow first, and results follow. This is the fundamental principle that unlocks exponential progress.

---

## Game Spaces & Life Questions

Each space (as defined in `game_spaces.md`) addresses a fundamental human question:

| Space | Core Question (EN) | Core Question (RU) | One Word |
|-------|-------------------|-------------------|----------|
| **Profile** | Who am I? What do I know? What can I do? | Кто я? Что знаю? Что умею? | **KNOW** |
| **Transformation** | How do I level up? How do I grow? | Как выйти на следующий уровень? | **GROW** |
| **Marketplace** | How do I earn well doing what I love? | Как хорошо зарабатывать, делая то, что люблю? | **THRIVE** |
| **Matchmaking** | Who are my people? | Кто близкие мне по духу люди? | **CONNECT** |
| **Venture Co-op** | What's mine to do? How do we build together? | Что мне делать в этом мире? | **SERVE** |

> **Note**: For detailed step-by-step user journey, see `customer_journey_map.md` (source of truth for sequence).

## 1. THRIVE Path (Genius Growth Path)

The journey from survival to thriving through genius monetization.

### Sequence & Questions

| Step | Name | Technology | The Question |
|------|------|------------|--------------|
| **1** | Articulate Genius | Appleseed | *What am I naturally best at?* |
| **2** | Unique Genius Offer | Excalibur | *How do I bring most value to others?* |
| **3** | Unique Business | Destiny | *What's the optimal business structure for me to thrive?* |
| **4** | Startup Coop | Holonic Venture Studio | *How do I build, sell, and scale my product?* |

### Flow Logic
```
Genius Discovery → Value Crystallization → Business Design → Market Execution
```

---

## 2. GROW Path (The Diagnostic Journey)

The inner development path that drives Quality of Life results.

### The Four Questions

| # | Question | What Happens |
|---|----------|--------------|
| **1** | *Where am I now?* | QoL Assessment — 8 life domains mapped to stages |
| **2** | *Where do I want to go?* | See next-level descriptions + **Drag-drop prioritization** |
| **3** | *How do I get there?* | The Recipe — all 5 Growth Paths ranked by relevance to chosen QoL goal |
| **4** | *What's my next step?* | Opens the **Daily Loop** |

### The Bridge Insight

```
QoL Assessment → Growth Potential Revealed → User Prioritizes Goals → 
Recipe Given (5 Growth Paths ranked for that goal) → Daily Loop Begins
```

**Key**: All 5 Growth Paths are involved for every QoL goal — they're just ranked differently. No single path alone unlocks results.

---

## 3. Daily Loop: The Exponential Growth Flywheel

Not "work" — **acceleration of growth**.

> The key is not just to grow, but to grow *faster*. Exponential results require exponential (accelerating) growth.

### The Flywheel (Hidden from User)

```
MICRO-LEARNING → EXPERIENCE → INTEGRATION → LEVEL UP → REPEAT
```

The system tracks where user is in the cycle internally. We recommend actions accordingly but don't expose the flywheel UI.

### Questions at Each Stage

| Stage | The Question |
|-------|--------------|
| **Micro-learning** | *What do I need to know to get to my next level?* |
| **Experience** | *What is it like?* / *How do I get a taste?* |
| **Integration** | *How does it look and feel in my life?* |
| **Level Up** | *How have I changed?* / *Who have I become?* |

---

## 4. Matchmaking Space (Connect & Collaborate)

### Mission Discovery
- Connect, Collaborate, Contribute, Serve
- Core question: *"What's mine to do in this world?"*
- Helps user reconnect with what they truly want to do

### Matching (MVP v1)

**Simple list format** (no tender mechanics for now):

| Match Category | Description |
|----------------|-------------|
| **Similar Genius** | People with most similar genius profile |
| **Complementary Genius** | People with most complementary genius |
| **Similar Mission** | People on a similar mission/path |

**Show**: Top 1 match per category (with refresh button)

**Filters** (toggles):
- Same location
- Same language(s)

---

## 5. Profile Space (Know Yourself)

### Core Questions
- *Who am I?*
- *What do I know?*
- *What can I do?*
- *What resources do I bring?*

### Required Profile Fields for Matching
- **Languages** user speaks fluently (multi-select)
- Location (optional)

---

## The Five Growth Paths (Vectors)

All vectors are interconnected. For ANY QoL goal, all 5 paths contribute — just ranked differently.

| Vector | Domain |
|--------|--------|
| **Body** | Physical vitality, energy, health |
| **Mind** | Thoughts, beliefs, mental models |
| **Emotions** | Feelings, emotional intelligence, shadow work |
| **Spirit** | Connection to source, presence, service |
| **Uniqueness** | Genius, authenticity, self-expression |

### Example: Wealth Goal
All 5 paths contribute:
1. **Uniqueness** — monetize genius (primary)
2. **Mind** — beliefs about money, business thinking
3. **Spirit** — being in service, opening heart
4. **Emotions** — shadow work around money, unprocessed blocks
5. **Body** — energy to execute

---

## First Micro-Learning Cycle: "The Five Vectors"

**Purpose**: Show users that the fastest path to any goal is developing all 5 vectors together.

| Stage | Content |
|-------|---------|
| **Micro-learning** | How all 5 vectors support each other |
| **Experience** | Feel what it's like when all vectors are active vs. when one drops |
| **Integration** | One week of tracking which vector drops — that's the focus |
| **Level Up** | First commitment = first level unlocked |

---

## What This Changes in the System

### New Features Needed

1. **QoL Priorities Drag-Drop UI**
   - After QoL, show next-level potential per domain
   - Drag-drop to rank priority
   - System personalizes Daily Loop based on this

2. **Recipe Screen**
   - Visual: "To grow in [Wealth], develop these paths in this order: [ranked list]"
   - Shows all 5 paths with different emphasis

3. **Matching List UI**
   - Simple cards showing top matches per category
   - Toggle filters: location, language

4. **Profile: Language Selection**
   - Multi-select for languages user speaks fluently
   
5. **First Cycle Content**
   - Basic course on 5 Vectors interconnection
