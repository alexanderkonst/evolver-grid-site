# Customer Journey Map

> Numbered step-by-step journey — every action mapped

*Modules exist for us. For the user: one simple, engaging path.*

---

## Core Principle: Self-First, Then Others

**Logic**: Clarity about self → Clarity about life → Clarity about action → Clarity about people

| Phase | Guiding Question | What User Gets |
|-------|------------------|----------------|
| **1. Zone of Genius** | *What am I naturally best at?* | Genius articulated |
| **2. Unique Offer** | *How do I bring most value to others?* | Offer crystallized |
| **3. Quality of Life** | *Where am I now? Where do I want to go?* | Life mapped + priorities |
| **4. Growth Recipe** | *How do I get there?* | 5 Growth Paths ranked |
| **5. Daily Loop** | *What's my next step?* | First action unlocked |
| **6. Matchmaking** | *Who are my people?* | Top match revealed |
| **7. Mission** | *What's mine to do in this world?* | Purpose clarified |

**Key insight**: Growth → Results (not reverse). QoL results are OUTPUT of inner development.

## Phase 2: Quality of Life (Wow #2)

### 2.0 Concept

**Wow → Wow transition**: From genius discovery to life mapping.

No drop-off here — one dopamine spike leads directly to another.

Key insight to communicate:
> "Your outer life is shaped by your inner development. Master yourself, upgrade your life."

### 2.1 Quality of Life Assessment

- **2.1.1** Explain the 8 domains (Wealth, Health, Happiness, Love, Impact, Growth, Social, Home)

- **2.1.2** Assess each domain (slider or stage selection)
  - 📈 Progress: "4/8 domains assessed"

- **2.1.3** Complete assessment

### 2.2 Reveal Moment #4: Life Snapshot

🎉 **DOPAMINE SPIKE**

- **2.2.1** Visual snapshot (radar chart or grid, infographic available)
- **2.2.2** Highest domains highlighted (celebrate wins)
- **2.2.3** Lowest domains highlighted (growth opportunities)

### 2.3 Biggest Growth Opportunity

- **2.3.1** Identify lowest domain(s)
  - If tie (e.g., two at stage 3), handle gracefully
  
- **2.3.2** Frame as opportunity:
  > "Your biggest growth opportunity is [Wealth]. This is what's holding you back — and where you'll see fastest results."

- **2.3.3** CTA: "Let's zoom in →"

### 2.4 Zoom-In: Precisify Your Position

**Purpose**: Get more granular data so system can recommend precisely.

- **2.4.1** Explain:
  > "Let's zoom in and see exactly where you are, so the system can find the right support for you."

- **2.4.2** Show substages within the lowest domain
  - Each stage (1-10) breaks into 5-10 substages
  - E.g., Stage 3 → 3.1, 3.2, 3.3... 3.9
  - User selects precise position

- **2.4.3** System now has precise data for recommendations

🔓 **UNLOCK**: "Now the system can recommend your exact next step"

### 2.5 Game World Entry

**First: Show Self-Development → Life Results Infographic**

- **2.5.1** Display 5 Vectors → 8 Domains visual:

```
┌─────────────────────────────────────────┐
│ SELF-DEVELOPMENT (5 Vectors)            │
│ Spirit · Mind · Emotions · Genius · Body │
│                 ↓                       │
│ LIFE RESULTS (8 Domains)                │
│ Wealth · Health · Happiness · Love ·    │
│ Impact · Growth · Social · Home         │
└─────────────────────────────────────────┘
```

- **2.5.2** Explain growth logic with example:
  > "Want more money? Develop your genius, upgrade your thinking, learn to regulate emotions, release limiting beliefs. This makes you more valuable to people and companies.
  > There's no magic button. Results follow development."

**Then: Show My Next Move**

- **2.5.3** Show "My Next Move" for first time
  - ONE recommended action based on profile + QoL

### 2.6 First Action Design (Easy Win)

**Principle**: First action must be EASY. 1-3 minutes. Guaranteed completion.

**Structure** (can vary):
- 📚 Micro-learning (1-2 min read/video)
- 🧘 Short practice (2-3 min)
- 📝 Integration (1-2 journal prompts)

**Examples**:
- "Watch this 90-second video on [X]"
- "Take 3 deep breaths and notice how you feel"
- "Write one sentence: What do you want to grow?"

🎉 **First Win → +XP → System unlocks → Visible progress begins**

### 2.7 Zoom-In Purpose (Optional/TBD)

**Why Zoom-In matters** (if implemented):
- Fast visible progress: 2.3 → 2.7 in one week
- E.g., "Earned first $50 from talents" = jump a substage
- Keeps motivation high with frequent micro-wins

*Note: 10×10 QoL = 100 positions. 10×10×10 = 1000 positions. Alexander exploring feasibility.*

## ✅ Answered Design Questions

### 1. What is "Onboarding"?

**Onboarding = ZoG + QoL + First Action**

| Phase | Name | Duration | Result |
|-------|------|----------|--------|
| 1 | Zone of Genius | ~5 min | Profile created |
| 2 | Quality of Life | ~5 min | Map created, recommendations active |
| 3 | First Action | 1-3 min | First win, XP earned |

**Onboarding ends when**: User has completed first action and sees visible progress.

### 2. How to Explain 5 Vectors → 8 Domains Simply?

**Universal language** (works for any community: spiritual, web3, crypto, etc.)

**The one-liner:**
> "Your self-development drives your life results."

**The visual (infographic) — Life Results → What Drives Them:**
```
LIFE RESULTS              ←     SELF-DEVELOPMENT
(what you want)                 (what you grow)

Wealth                         Genius + Mind + Emotions
Health                         Body + Emotions + Spirit
Happiness                      Spirit + Emotions + Mind
Love                           Emotions + Spirit + Body
Impact                         Genius + Mind + Spirit
Growth                         Mind + Spirit + All
Social                         Emotions + Genius + Mind
Home                           Body + Emotions + Spirit
```

**The simple explanation:**
> "Each life result is driven by different parts of your development."

---

### 3. When Does User First See Growth Paths?

**After completing QoL assessment.**

| Milestone | What's Visible |
|---------|----------------|
| ZoG Done | QoL Assessment only |
| QoL Done | Game World, Transformation Space, Profile Space |
| First Action | XP, level, streak |
| Genius Offer Created | Matchmaking, Startup Co-op, Marketplace Shop |

**Why**: Progressive unlock creates investment and reduces overwhelm.

---

### 4. What's the Ideal First Action?

**Depends on lowest QoL domain:**

| Lowest Domain | First Action |
|---------------|--------------|
| Wealth | "Watch: How genius becomes income" (90 sec) |
| Health | "3 deep breaths + body scan" (2 min) |
| Happiness | "Gratitude journaling" (1 min) |
| Love | "Appreciation message to someone" (2 min) |
| Impact | "Clarify your contribution" (2 min prompt) |
| Growth | "Set one learning intention" (1 min) |
| Social | "Reach out to one person" (1 min) |
| Home | "Improve one small thing in your space" (3 min) |

**Principle**: First action is EASY, domain-relevant, and 1-3 minutes.

## Notes

- **Modules are invisible to users** — they just experience flow
- **Steps are numbered** for precise discussion and development
- **Personalized recommendations** = big deal (not same for everyone)
- **Most users** will likely start with Wealth/Genius (economic vector)
