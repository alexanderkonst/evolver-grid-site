# Customer Journey — Progression & Unlocks

> The exact sequence of steps a user takes from entry to full platform access
> Each step unlocks the next through demonstrated engagement

*Day 5 — Jan 8, 2026*

---

## Core Principle

**Nothing is visible until it's earned.**  
The platform reveals itself progressively as users demonstrate commitment.

---

## Phase 1: Unique Gift (Entry)

### What Happens
1. User lands on Unique Gift wizard
2. Completes the discovery flow (AI-first or manual)
3. **First Aha Moment** — Results revealed:
   - Archetype
   - Core talents
   - The One Action (path to mastery)
   - Genius colors (visual identity)

### What's NOT Visible Yet
- No sidebar
- No game world
- No other modules
- Just the ZoG experience

---

## Phase 2: Quality of Life Snapshot

### Transition Logic
> "You know your genius. Now let's map your life in 10 minutes."

### What Happens
1. 8-domain QoL assessment (quick, visual)
2. **Second Aha Moment** — QoL snapshot:
   - Strengths and growth opportunities
   - "Your biggest growth opportunity: [Domain]"
   - Visual representation

### What Unlocks
- The Game World (sidebar appears)
- Profile Space (ZoG + QoL visible)
- Transformation Space (available but not yet used)

---

## Phase 3: First Unit of Transformation

### Transition Logic
> "To grow your [Biggest Opportunity], here's your first practice."

### What Happens
1. AI recommends a Growth Path that supports their growth opportunity
2. User completes **first transformational unit** (micro-learning)
3. The video/content explains:
   - What this Growth Path develops
   - **Which QoL domains it supports** *(important link)*
4. **Third Aha Moment** — "I just grew"

### What Unlocks
- Progress tracking (XP, level)
- Option to continue transformation OR pivot to Genius Discovery

---

## Phase 4: Two Next Actions

After first transformation, the user sees TWO suggested actions:

| Option 1 | Option 2 |
|----------|----------|
| **Continue Genius Discovery** | **Continue Transformation** |
| "Find how to make your genius useful" | "Do your second unit: [Specific Name]" |

### UI Treatment
- Both options shimmer/glow to draw attention
- Previous completed actions shown with ✓ green checkmark
- Creates investment effect (Tamagotchi psychology)

---

## Phase 5: Genius Discovery Continuation

Three progressive steps:

| Step | Internal Name | User-Facing Name | Description |
|------|---------------|------------------|-------------|
| 1 | Genius Articulation | "Articulate Your Genius" | Clarity on unique gifts |
| 2 | Genius Made Useful | "Make Your Genius Useful" | How to apply genius to serve others |
| 3 | Genius Monetized | "Monetize Your Genius" | Human-in-the-loop paid service |

**Step 3 requires human coaching** — this is a monetization point.

---

## Phase 6: The Tour

> After ZoG + QoL, the user sees the Game World for the first time.
> The Tour introduces the 5 spaces and what each unlocks.
