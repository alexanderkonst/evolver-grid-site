## Network School 2.0 Member Platform

**The Hack:** Position the prototype as "Network School 2.0 Member Platform"

**Setup:**
- QR code printed, sitting in the cafeteria
- Big text: "PROTOTYPE — Network School 2.0 Member Platform"
- Disclaimer: "Not official — created by a fellow member"

**Why It Works:**
- Everyone passes through that cafeteria
- Current member platform is unused (opportunity gap)
- You become the gravity well, not the chaser
- Word spreads → Jackson sees → Balaji hears

**Amplifiers:**
- Book a session: "Feedback on NS 2.0 Prototype"
- Stay at table for hours — creates curiosity
- Have laptop open showing the platform
