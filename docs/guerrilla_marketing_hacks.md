## Network School 2.0 Member Platform

**The Hack:** Position the prototype as "Network School 2.0 Member Platform"

**Setup:**
- QR code printed, sitting in the cafeteria
- Big text: "PROTOTYPE — Network School 2.0 Member Platform"
- Disclaimer: "Not official — created by a fellow member"

**Why It Works:**
- Everyone passes through that cafeteria
- Current member platform is unused (opportunity gap)
- You become the gravity well, not the chaser
- Word spreads → Jackson sees → Balaji hears

**Amplifiers:**
- Book a session: "Feedback on NS 2.0 Prototype"
- Stay at table for hours — creates curiosity
- Have laptop open showing the platform

## Historic Inspiration

### The Knighted Comedian (Mischief)
Some guy managed to get knighted by the King through absurd social engineering. Research this for inspiration.

### MrBeast Pattern

### Flash Mob Energy

- Creates a moment of collective attention
- Memorable because it breaks routine

## Principles

1. **Pull, don't push** — Become the magnet
2. **Create the vacuum** — Fill a gap that exists
3. **Make it undeniable** — So good they can't ignore
4. **Story-worthy** — People want to tell others

## The Playlist Lead Magnet

**Day 1:** QR code + sign: "Dope Deep Work Playlist"

- Color 1 (e.g., blue)
- Ask people before giving QR: "Want a dope deep work playlist?"
- Hand them the QR → they scan → they get value
- That's it. No ask. Just give.

**Day 2:** Different color sign (e.g., orange)

- Same spot, same guy
- New QR: "NS 2.0 Member Portal — Prototype"
- People already recognize you as "playlist guy"
- Reciprocity activated: they got value, now they want to give back
- They scan → join → provide feedback → feel good

**Why It Works:**
- First give, then ask (reciprocity)
- Two touches before the sell
- Color change signals "new thing"
- Consent-based (you ask before giving)
- If they listened to the playlist and loved it → warm lead
