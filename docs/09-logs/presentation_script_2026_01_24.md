## Opening Hook (30 seconds)

"This morning, people could discover their genius and get a 10/10 resonance — but they couldn't monetize it.

Tonight, I have the solution: **One Button → Published Product**."

## The Gap Problem (1 minute)

**Show Excalibur screen**

"This is Excalibur — our AI that helps people discover their Unique Business. It works. People love it. 10/10 resonance.

But there was a gap: *'I know my genius... now what?'*

They had self-recognition without a path to revenue."

## The Solution: Product Builder (1.5 minutes)

**Demo the flow:**

1. **Launch from Excalibur** → "One button: Launch Product Builder"
2. **Entry Screen** → "Clear promise: 15 minutes to published product"
3. **ICP Screen** → "AI deepens their ideal client understanding"
4. **Pain Screen** → "Using Pain Theory — pressure, consequences, stakes"
5. **Promise Screen** → "Point A → Point B crystallization"
6. **Landing Page** → "Live preview of their sales page"
7. **Blueprint** → "Methodology as lead magnet"
8. **CTA** → "Session or Software"
9. **Published** → *trigger confetti* "🎉 They're live on marketplace"

## The Meta-Insight: AI-Assisted Development (1 minute)

"The task list estimated 32 hours.

We built it in 30 minutes.

That's **AI-assisted development**.

How? 

- Human vision + AI execution
- UX Playbook = pre-digested design
- Pattern recognition across the codebase
- Mock-first: ship now, perfect later

This IS the Unique Business Studio in action."

## The Bigger Vision (1 minute)

"Today: Landing Page
Tomorrow: Full product generation + marketing materials

The goal: **One button → Complete business**

From Unique Gift discovery to published, purchasable product.

The acorn becomes the oak."

## New Frameworks Introduced Today (30 seconds)

## Closing (30 seconds)

"This hackathon proved that when you combine:
