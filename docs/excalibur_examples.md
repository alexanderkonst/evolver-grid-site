---

### Excalibur (Sword)

**Excalibur Offer (1 sentence):**
I work with people who are between chapters, with real offers and options on the table, to help them choose the few rooms and roles that are truly theirs for the next 3–5 years, leave the ones that aren't, and step into the right settings with the right people — including warm introductions — so they don't drift into another 2–3-year detour.

**Form:** 2-session Right Rooms, Real Role process (Session 1 + Tracey's mapping + Session 2, with optional check-in)

**Promise:**
To turn a messy, over-full web of rooms and options into a clear next chapter:
- one strong role sentence
- a small set of core rooms to build around
- clear exits
- key people to deepen with
- real moves in motion within 1–3 months

**Deliverable (≈2–3 pages):**
- Role sentence for this phase
- 3–5 core rooms to prioritize
- Let-go list with suggested wording
- 5–10 key people to lean into
- 2–3 warm introductions from Tracey
- 60–90 day shift plan

---

### Value (Survival Unlock)

- **Who benefits most?** People who have built/led meaningful things, are in many rooms at once, are between chapters, and feel: "I have good options, but I don't want to fall into another 2–3 years in the wrong setup."
- **What survival-block does this cut?** The pattern that says "If I keep saying yes and stay in everything, I'll be safe and won't miss out"
- **Immediate Aha:** "I don't need more options or more rooms. I need to choose my real place, commit to it, and let the rest go."

- **Secondary Channel:** Occasional honest shares about the pattern on email/LinkedIn/small circles
- **Message/Hook:** "You're in many good rooms, but not clearly in your place — let's choose your real game, pick your few key rooms, and use my network to help you step into them."

---

- **Compound Archetype:** Temple Builder of Futures · Land Listener · Team Firekeeper

---

### Excalibur (Sword)

**Excalibur Offer (1 sentence):**
For the Visionary Steward whose New Earth land project is stuck between vision and construction, Tylor serves as a Sacred Architect who listens to the land and the founder to distill a Project Soulprint and translate it into a simple, buildable roadmap that aligns land, team, and timeline so the first stone — and every next step — becomes clear.

**Form:** The Structural Reset — a focused Land Vision Architecture Sprint (≈6–7 hours, one or two sessions)

**Promise:**
To transform a vague or stalled land vision into a coherent, land-aligned, team-ready Project Soulprint and a construction-ready roadmap that everyone can finally rally around.

**Deliverable – Project Soulprint Pack:**
- Land listening & narrative (what the land is asking for)
- Core concept & program of the place
- Phased development roadmap — the Sacred Sequence
- Team constellation (who is needed where, when)
- Key milestones and immediate next actions

---

### Value (Survival Unlock)

- **Who benefits most?** Visionary land stewards and small founding teams who have land (or imminent access), a clear sense of purpose, and at least some funding, but are stuck in the Money–Motion Gap.
- **What survival-block does this cut?** The paralysis between "we have the land and the dream" and "we know what to build first, with whom, and on what timeline before money and energy run out."
- **Immediate Aha:** "I don't have to hold this alone or keep guessing. This is a real, buildable project now — with clear phases, people, and timelines that others can finally say yes to."
