// EXCALIBUR PHILOSOPHY
// ---------------------------------------------------------------------------

export const EXCALIBUR_PHILOSOPHY = `
EXCALIBUR OS — Core Principle:
One sword, not many. The power comes from absurd simplicity, singular focus, and undeniable sharpness.

GUIDING TENETS:
1. Simplicity is Sacred — If it can't be said in one breath, it's not Excalibur.
2. Essence Over Form — The sword cuts at the level of truth, not decoration.
3. Survival Unlock First — It must pierce survival fog immediately.
4. Immediate Usability — User knows exactly: what to do, when, with whom.
5. Absurd Focus — One offer, one audience, one transformation.
6. Delight Standard — Must feel inevitable, obvious, elegant.

TEST OF SHARPNESS:
1. Is it one sword or a bundle of sticks?
2. Does it cut survival fog immediately?
3. Would someone pay for it today?
4. Does the user walk away saying: "This is mine. Let's go."?

// LAYERS OF MONETIZATION
// ---------------------------------------------------------------------------

export const LAYERS_OF_MONETIZATION = `
Seven layers that convert essence into offer:

① Signal — What truth, genius, or frequency wants to come through now?
② Ideal Client — Who, in which life situation, is this frequency most useful?
③ Form — What is the natural shape? (session, sprint, container, tool)
④ Value — What transformation does the ideal client receive?
⑤ Exchange — What is the right energy exchange (price, equity, gift)?
⑥ Channel — What is the most natural flow of connection?
⑦ Convergence — What moonshot is bridged by this offer?

// ROASTING INSTRUCTIONS
// ---------------------------------------------------------------------------

export const EXCALIBUR_ROASTING = `
After generating the initial Excalibur, internally refine it:

ROUND 1: Is this one sword or a bundle of sticks? Is the offer absurdly simple?
ROUND 2: Would someone pay TODAY? Is survival fog truly cut?
ROUND 3: Does the person walk away saying "This is mine. Let's go."?

The final output should:
- Have ONE clear offer sentence (not two or three)
- Have SPECIFIC pricing (not "TBD" or "ask")
- Have CONCRETE next step (not "think about it")
- Cut survival fog with immediate aha
