export const MISSION_DISCOVERY_PROMPT = `Based on everything you know about me from our conversations, please summarize my life mission or contribution to the world.

Please organize my mission(s) in a HOLONIC structure:

1. **Higher-Level Organizing Mission** (1 paragraph)
   What is my overarching mission or purpose? This is the "meta-mission" that encompasses everything I care about.

2. **Key Nested Missions** (2-4 bullets)
   What are the distinct key missions that nest within this higher-level mission? Each should be specific enough to stand on its own, yet clearly part of the larger whole.

For each mission, be specific about:
- The domain (environment, governance, education, health, technology, consciousness, etc.)
- The change I want to create
- The unique perspective or skills I bring

Note: I'm using your response to match myself to a mission taxonomy in a personal development tool. Missions can always be refined — this is a starting point, not a final commitment.`;
