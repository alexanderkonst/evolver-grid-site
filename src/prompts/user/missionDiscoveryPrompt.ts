export const MISSION_DISCOVERY_PROMPT = `Based on everything you know about me from our conversations, please summarize my life mission or contribution to the world.

Please organize my mission(s) in a HOLONIC structure:

1. **Higher-Level Organizing Mission** (1 paragraph)
   What is my overarching mission or purpose? This is the "meta-mission" that encompasses everything I care about.

2. **Key Nested Missions** (2-4 bullets)
   What are the distinct key missions that nest within this higher-level mission? Each should be specific enough to stand on its own, yet clearly part of the larger whole.

For each mission, be specific about:
- The domain (environment, governance, education, health, technology, consciousness, etc.)
- The change I want to create
- The unique perspective or skills I bring

**IMPORTANT LANGUAGE REQUIREMENTS:**
- Use universally understandable language that anyone can grasp
- Avoid technical jargon, academic terms, or specialized vocabulary (e.g., no words like "holonic", "ontological", "integral", "systemic")
- Write as if explaining to a curious 15-year-old

**RESPONSE FORMAT:**
- Answer only the question above
- Do NOT add any follow-up suggestions, options, or offers to provide more
- Do NOT ask if I want visual codes, next steps, or additional variations
- End your response after the mission description

Note: I'm using your response to match myself to a mission taxonomy in a personal development tool. Missions can always be refined — this is a starting point, not a final commitment.`;
