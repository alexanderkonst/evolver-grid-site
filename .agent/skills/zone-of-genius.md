# Zone of Genius Generation Skill

Use this skill when generating or refining a user's Zone of Genius profile.

## What is Appleseed?

Appleseed is a high-precision articulation of someone's Zone of Genius across 12 perspectives. It transforms raw understanding into a resonant, archetypal profile.

## The 12 Perspectives

1. **Bullseye Sentence** — One phrase capturing their essence (verb form: "I [verb]...")
2. **Unique Vibrational Key** — Archetypal name + tagline
3. **Zone of Genius — Three Lenses** — Actions, Prime Driver, Archetype
4. **What They're Appreciated & Paid For** — Effect → Scene → Outcome
5. **Mastery Stages** — 6-7 stages of evolution
6. **Professional Activities** — LinkedIn-searchable roles
7. **Roles & Environments** — As Creator, Contributor, Founder + ideal vibe
8. **Best Complementary Partner** — Who to seek
9. **Monetization Avenues** — How to monetize
10. **Life Scene** — Sensory embodiment in flow
11. **Visual Codes** — Symbolic anchors
12. **Elevator Pitch** — Final synthesis

## One Action to Mastery

The Prime Driver (from perspective #3) in verb form is the **One Action to Mastery** — the single action that, when practiced consistently, leads to full genius expression.

## Quality Standards

- Vibrational Key must be UNIQUE (not generic like "Visionary Leader")
- Life Scene must be SENSORY and SPECIFIC
- No filler words in Elevator Pitch
- Person should recognize themselves instantly
