## Step-by-Step Execution

### Step 1: SEED (Zone of Genius Articulation)
1. Collect 12 perspective answers from founder (or existing Appleseed data)
2. Synthesize into Zone of Genius card:
   - Vibrational Key (one-sentence essence)
   - Bullseye Sentence
   - Compound Archetype
3. Apply 3x Roasting cycles internally
4. Present to founder
5. **GATE:** Ask: *"Does this feel true?"*
6. Update tracker: mark Step 1 complete

### Step 2: OFFER (Excalibur Crystallization)
1. From ZoG → derive offer:
   - One-sentence offer
   - Form (session/container/product)
   - Promise + Deliverable
   - Pricing (pilot + standard rate)
   - Channel
   - ICP v1 (initial hypothesis)
2. Apply 3x Roasting cycles internally
3. Present to founder
4. **GATE:** Ask: *"Would you sell this tomorrow?"*
5. Update tracker

### Step 3: ICP (Tribe Definition)
1. Ask founder: *"Describe the tribe you represent"*
2. Document **internal qualifiers** (recognition filters, not messaging)
3. Ask founder: *"Describe their life situation right now"*
4. Document the **life moment** in vivid detail
5. Assess **awareness stage** (Schwartz 1-5)
6. Save to `docs/02-strategy/[venture]_icp_deepened.md`
7. **GATE:** Ask: *"Is this a real person you know? Can you name 5?"*
8. Update tracker

### Step 4: PAIN (5-Layer Slicer)
1. Apply each layer sequentially using founder's ICP input:
   - **Layer 1 — Struggle:** What they'd say if asked "what's going on?"
   - **Layer 2 — Pressure:** What's pushing toward a decision NOW?
   - **Layer 3 — Consequences:** What they experience daily (body, mind, emotions, relationships, identity)
   - **Layer 4 — Cost of Inaction:** What happens in 6 months if nothing changes?
   - **Layer 5 — Urgency Levers:** What countdown is already running?
2. Extract **Self-Language Inventory** — 8-12 exact phrases they say to themselves
3. Add pain data to the ICP document
4. **GATE:** Ask: *"Would they cry reading this?"*
5. Update tracker

### Step 5: TP (Transformational Promise)
1. Fill in PMF Hypothesis:
   ```
   If A had B, they'd have no more C.
   A = [from Step 3]
   B = [from Step 2]
   C = [from Step 4]
   ```
2. Write one-sentence TP: *"From [Point A feeling] to [Point B reality]"*
3. Apply 3x Roasting using TP Deepening Template (`docs/02-strategy/tp_deepening_template.md`)
4. **GATE:** Ask: *"Can you say this naturally in conversation?"*
5. Update tracker

### Step 6: BLUEPRINT (3-Step Method)
1. Identify transformation mechanism: "Converts [X] into [Y]"
2. Name 3 phases (verb-based, memorable):
   - Phase 1: [SEEING] — what question does it answer? What output?
   - Phase 2: [SHAPING] — what question? What output?
   - Phase 3: [SHIPPING] — what question? What output?
3. Verify sequence logic: "Without Phase 1, Phase 2 fails because..."
4. **GATE:** Ask: *"Could someone explain this in 30 seconds?"*
5. Update tracker

### Step 7: POSITIONING (Messaging)
1. Generate 3 versions:
   - **Pain-Forward** (for Stage 2 ICP): Leads with their self-language
   - **Method-Forward** (for known audiences): Leads with Blueprint names
   - **Result-Forward** (for warm referrals): Leads with outcome
2. Generate context variations: LinkedIn headline, website hero, conversation opener
3. **GATE:** Ask: *"Can you say this naturally?"*
4. Update tracker

### Step 8: LANDING PAGE (Build + Deploy)
1. Follow the Landing Page Formula:
   - Hero: Pain recognition using self-language from Step 4
   - Problem: Expand wound (NOT the solution yet)
   - Solution: Blueprint from Step 6
   - Filter: "For you if… / Not for you if…"
   - About: Brief credibility
   - CTA: Booking link
2. Build the page (code or no-code)
3. Deploy and verify
4. **GATE:** Ask: *"Would the ICP read the first two sentences and feel seen?"*
5. Update tracker

### Step 9: DISTRIBUTION (3 Channels)
1. **Channel 1 — Warm Network:**
   - List 30-50 people who match the ICP
   - Draft personal message template
2. **Channel 2 — Content Home:**
   - Choose ONE platform (match ICP location + founder comfort)
   - Define 3-5 content pillars from methodology
   - Set minimum viable rhythm
3. **Channel 3 — Referral Loop:**
   - Design end-of-session referral ask
   - Create referral script
4. **GATE:** Ask: *"Is this sustainable for your capacity?"*
5. Update tracker

### Step 10: LAUNCH (30-Day Plan)
1. Set revenue target
2. Work backwards:
   ```
   Revenue target ÷ offer price = sessions needed
   Sessions needed × 2 = conversations needed
   Conversations needed × 2.5 = outreach messages needed
   Outreach ÷ 14 working days = daily outreach volume
   ```
3. Create week-by-week plan:
   - Week 1: Activate warm network
   - Week 2: First sessions + first revenue
   - Week 3: Momentum + testimonials
   - Week 4: Convert remaining + assess
4. Create daily checklist template
5. **GATE:** Ask: *"Are daily actions achievable?"*
6. Update tracker: mark complete

## After Completion

Once Step 10 is done and first revenue is validated:
- **Value Ladder:** Build 5-tier offer ecosystem → see genius_venture_playbook.md Workflow 7
- **Product:** Turn validated offer into software → see integrated_product_building_workflow.md
- **Scale:** Grow from 1:1 to 1:many → see distribution_playbook.md
