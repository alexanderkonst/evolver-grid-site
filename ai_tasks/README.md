# AI Tasks Folder

This folder contains tasks for AI agents to complete.

## How It Works

1. **PENDING_** files = Tasks waiting to be done
2. **DONE_** files = Completed tasks
3. **Agent reads → does work → renames file**

## Agents

| Agent | Role | Task Types |
|-------|------|------------|
| **Gemini** | Architect | Writes tasks, reviews work |
| **Codex** | Lead Engineer | Implements features, writes code |
| **Claude** (future) | Senior Dev | Complex logic, refactoring |

## For Codex

When you see this folder, do this:
1. Read all `PENDING_*.md` files
2. Complete each task as described
3. Rename to `DONE_*.md` when finished
4. Commit your changes

## Naming Convention

```
PENDING_short_description.md
DONE_short_description.md
```
