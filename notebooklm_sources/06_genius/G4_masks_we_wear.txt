Module G4: The Masks We Wear

Key Question: What stops me from showing up fully?

Script:

We all wear masks. Different versions of ourselves for different contexts.

This is partly healthy — we adapt to situations. But it becomes a problem when we forget who we are underneath the masks.

Common masks:

The Pleaser — Always agreeable, never rocking the boat. Hides authentic opinions.

The Achiever — Defined by accomplishments. Hides vulnerability and needs.

The Helper — Always giving, never receiving. Hides their own needs by focusing on others.

The Expert — Must always know the answer. Hides uncertainty and learning.

The Rebel — Always against something. Hides a desire to belong.

Each mask was created for protection. But wearing it constantly is exhausting.

The question to ask: Which mask am I wearing right now? And what's underneath it?

Slowly, with awareness and compassion, we can take off the masks and show up more real.

Key Takeaway:

Masks were created for protection. With awareness, we can take them off and show up more authentically.
