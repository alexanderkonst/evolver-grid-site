Module G6: Genius in Full Expression

Key Question: What does genius fully expressed look like?

Script:

When genius is fully expressed, life transforms:

Alignment — Your work, relationships, and lifestyle all flow from who you actually are. No more forcing.

Effortlessness — What once required effort now happens naturally. You're in flow state more often than not.

Value creation — You create massive value because you're operating from your zone. People pay gladly for what you offer.

Energy surplus — Work gives you energy instead of taking it. You finish the day with more than you started.

Magnetic presence — Others are drawn to you. Not because you're performing, but because authenticity is magnetic.

Contribution — Your genius serves something larger. It's not just about you — it's about what flows through you.

This isn't about becoming famous or rich (though it might happen). It's about living as yourself — fully, undefended, expressed.

That's the Genius path.

Key Takeaway:

Genius fully expressed = alignment + effortlessness + value + energy + magnetism + contribution. Living as yourself.
