Module G2: Discovering Your Zone of Genius

Key Question: How do I discover what my genius actually is?

Script:

There's a framework called the Zone of Genius, and here's how to use it:

Imagine four zones:

Zone of Incompetence — Things you're bad at. Others do them much better. Stop doing these.

Zone of Competence — Things you're okay at. Many people can do them just as well. Minimize these.

Zone of Excellence — Things you're really good at. You get paid well for them. But they don't light you up. This is the trap!

Zone of Genius — Things that are easy for you AND give you energy AND create unique value. This is the target.

The Zone of Excellence is the trap because it's comfortable. You're successful there. But over time, it drains you.

To find your Zone of Genius, ask:
- What do I do effortlessly?
- What gives me energy rather than taking it?
- What do people come to me for?
- What would I do even if I wasn't paid?

Key Takeaway:

Zone of Genius = effortless + energizing + uniquely valuable. The Zone of Excellence is the trap — good but draining.
