Module G3: Articulating Your Genius Offer

Key Question: Okay, I know my zone. But how do I actually express it?

Script:

Once you know your Zone of Genius, you need to articulate it in a way that others understand.

This is your Genius Offer — how you create value for others from your zone.

Here's a simple formula:

I help [WHO] achieve [WHAT] through [HOW].

For example:
- "I help entrepreneurs clarify their vision through strategic questioning."
- "I help teams align through facilitated dialogue."
- "I help people relax through massage and presence."

The WHO is your ideal client — the person who most needs what you offer.

The WHAT is the outcome — what they get from working with you.

The HOW is your unique approach — the thing that makes you different.

If you can say this clearly, you can show up with confidence. You know what you're offering. Others can understand it.

Key Takeaway:

Genius Offer = "I help [WHO] achieve [WHAT] through [HOW]." Clarity creates confidence.
