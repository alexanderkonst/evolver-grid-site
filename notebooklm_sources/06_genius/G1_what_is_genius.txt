Module G1: What is Genius?

Key Question: What exactly is Genius, and why does it matter for my growth?

Script:

GENIUS is your path of showing up in life — your path of authenticity and true self-expression. Where you go from wearing masks to more and more authenticity.

Everyone has a genius. Not "genius" as in Einstein-level IQ. Genius as in: the unique way you naturally create value.

It's the thing you do well without trying too hard. The thing people come to you for. The thing that lights you up when you're doing it.

Most people suppress their genius. They think: "That's too easy, it can't be valuable." Or: "I should be doing something more practical." So they hide it.

The Genius path is about uncovering what was always there and learning to express it fully.

Metric: How well you can articulate who you are, what you do, who your ideal client is, and what you naturally do best — and how much you actually show up according to that.

High development: Better and better monetization of your talents. Life aligned with your true nature.

Key Takeaway:

Genius is your unique way of naturally creating value. The path is about uncovering and expressing it fully.
