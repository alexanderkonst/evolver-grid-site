Module G5: Authentic Expression

Key Question: How do I start showing up more authentically?

Script:

Authentic expression isn't about becoming someone new. It's about removing what's not you.

Here are some practices:

1. Notice dissonance — When you say something that doesn't feel true, notice it. That's a clue to inauthenticity.

2. Speak small truths — Start by saying what's actually true in low-stakes situations. "I don't like that movie." "I'm tired." Build the muscle.

3. Tolerate discomfort — Authenticity can feel scary. People might not like the real you. That's okay. Keep going.

4. Honor your no — When you don't want to do something, say no. A clear no protects your yes.

5. Follow your energy — Pay attention to what lights you up. Do more of that. Less of what drains.

6. Create something — Expression needs an outlet. Write, speak, build, design, teach, make. Put yourself out there.

Authenticity is a practice, not a destination. Each small act of showing up real builds the capacity for more.

Key Takeaway:

Authentic expression practices: notice dissonance, speak truths, tolerate discomfort, honor no, follow energy, create.
