Module E4: Working with Intense Emotions

Key Question: What about emotions that are really overwhelming?

Script:

For truly intense emotions — grief, rage, terror — the basic protocol may not be enough. Here are additional tools:

1. Titration — Don't try to process it all at once. Dip into the emotion for a few seconds, then come back out. Repeat. Slowly increasing tolerance.

2. Pendulation — Move attention between the painful sensation and somewhere in your body that feels neutral or okay. Back and forth. The nervous system regulates through contrast.

3. Anchoring — Before going into difficult emotions, establish a strong sense of safety. Feel your feet on the ground. Notice the support of the chair. Feel the breath. This is your anchor to return to.

4. Professional support — Some emotions need professional holding. A skilled therapist, somatic practitioner, or trauma specialist can help process what's too much to handle alone.

5. Movement — Sometimes emotions need to be moved through the body. Shaking, dancing, exercising, making sounds. The body knows how to release.

The goal isn't to eliminate intense emotions. It's to expand capacity — to be able to feel more without being overwhelmed.

Key Takeaway:

For intense emotions: titration, pendulation, anchoring, professional support, movement. Expand capacity gradually.
