Module E2: Emotional Patterns and Origins

Key Question: Why do I react the way I react? Where do my patterns come from?

Script:

Most of our emotional reactions were formed in childhood.

A child experiences something overwhelming — a moment of fear, rejection, abandonment, shame. The child doesn't have the tools to process it. So the psyche does what it can: it creates a protective pattern.

"I'll never ask for help again." (Protection from rejection.)
"I'll always be good." (Protection from abandonment.)
"I'll never show weakness." (Protection from shame.)

These patterns worked — they helped the child survive. But decades later, we're still running the same software.

The trigger happens → the old pattern activates → we react automatically, without choice.

This is what people call triggers. A present-moment event activates old programming.

The path of emotions is about updating the software. Recognizing the patterns, understanding their origin, and creating space for new responses.

Key Takeaway:

Our emotional reactions are childhood survival patterns still running. Recognizing them is the first step to updating them.
