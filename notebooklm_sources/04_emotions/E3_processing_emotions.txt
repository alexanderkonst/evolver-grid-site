Module E3: Processing Emotions

Key Question: How do I actually process an emotion instead of reacting?

Script:

Here's a simple protocol for processing emotions in the moment:

1. Pause — When you notice an emotional charge, stop. Don't act. Don't speak. Just pause.

2. Locate — Where in your body do you feel it? Chest? Stomach? Throat? Locate the sensation.

3. Allow — Instead of pushing it away, let it be there. Give it permission to exist fully.

4. Stay — Remain with the sensation. Watch it. Don't try to change it. Just watch.

5. Breathe — Breathe into the location. Not forcing — just gentle attention.

6. Wait for shift — Emotions move when we allow them. Watch for the shift. It might take 90 seconds. It might take longer.

7. Listen — What is this emotion trying to tell you? What's the message?

This is radically different from reacting (acting out the emotion) or suppressing (pushing it down). This is processing — letting the emotion complete its natural cycle.

Key Takeaway:

Process emotions: Pause → Locate → Allow → Stay → Breathe → Wait for shift → Listen. This completes the cycle.
