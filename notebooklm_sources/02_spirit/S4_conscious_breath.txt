Module S4: Conscious Breath

Key Question: What's the simplest practice that accelerates all growth?

Script:

The conscious breath is deceptively simple yet profoundly powerful.

Here's what science and ancient wisdom agree on:

Breathe through your nose — not your mouth. Nose breathing has neurological benefits that mouth breathing lacks.

Belly out on inhale — this is how children and all mammals breathe naturally. Most adults do the opposite, slightly suffocating themselves with each breath.

5.5 seconds is the magic number — HeartMath research shows that breathing in for 5.5 seconds and out for 5.5 seconds creates coherence in your heart rate variability.

Heart centering amplifies everything — as you breathe, drop your awareness from your head into the very center of your heart. This tiny center is the gateway to expanded states of consciousness.

This is the Master Practice. If you do nothing else, do this.

Key Takeaway:

Nose breathing, belly out on inhale, 5.5 second rhythm, heart centering. The simplest practice that accelerates all growth.
