Module S8: Intuitive Knowing

Key Question: How do I hear my intuition more clearly?

Script:

There is a voice of wisdom inside you. It's always there. The problem is, it's quiet.

The thinking brain has a high signal — lots of noise. The intuition has a low signal — subtle, easily drowned out.

To hear intuition, we need to quiet the thinking mind. Not suppress it — just notice it.

When the chatter quiets, the intuitive voice becomes audible. It was always there.

Key Takeaway:

Intuition is always there but quiet. To hear it, notice your thoughts — they naturally calm. Awareness amplifies intuition.
