Module S10: States of Consciousness

Key Question: What are the different states of consciousness I can experience?

Script:

There is a map of states of consciousness:

Waking state (Gross) — Normal everyday awareness. Physical objects, sounds, thoughts.

Subtle state — You perceive energy, images, dreams, visions. Meditation takes you here.

Causal state — Formless awareness. Pure being. Deep meditation or deep sleep.

Witness state — Awareness of awareness itself. You're not the thoughts — you're the one watching.

Non-dual / Oneness — Separation collapses. Just seamless experience.

You don't need to chase these states. They arise naturally as you practice. The map helps you recognize where you are.

Key Takeaway:

States of consciousness: Gross → Subtle → Causal → Witness → Non-dual. They arise naturally with practice.
