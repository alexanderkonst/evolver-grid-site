Module S7: Decision Making by Feeling

Key Question: How do I use feelings to make better decisions?

Script:

Here is a neurological fact: we make decisions by feeling, not by thinking.

Thinking helps us analyze options. But the actual moment of decision — when we choose — is not rational. It's emotional.

So when you need to make a decision:

1. Analyze your options — let your mind do its job
2. Then feel into each one — which feels more aligned? Expansive? Contracted?
3. Trust the feeling — especially if it's clear

The implication: the more you develop your sensitivity, the better your decision-making becomes.

Key Takeaway:

Decisions are made by feeling, not thinking. Analyze with mind, decide with feeling.
