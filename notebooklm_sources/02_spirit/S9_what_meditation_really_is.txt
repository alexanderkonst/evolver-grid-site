Module S9: What Meditation Really Is

Key Question: What is meditation really?

Script:

People think meditation is what we do when we meditate — and the rest of life is not meditation.

In reality, what people call "meditation" is simply: increasing consciousness intentionally.

The key: 80% of the brain's bandwidth is visual. When you close your eyes — massive resources freed up.

Then:
- Silence minimizes sound input
- Stillness minimizes movement input
- Solitude minimizes energy exchange with others

Closed eyes + silence + stillness + solitude = blankness.

In blankness, we can finally see what's actually happening inside.

Key Takeaway:

Meditation = minimizing input (visual, sound, movement, people) to see your inner experience clearly.
