Module S2: Noticing Present Moment

Key Question: How do I start developing awareness?

Script:

It starts with the basics. Three simple questions you can ask yourself at any moment:

1. What am I thinking? — What thoughts are running through my mind right now?
2. What am I doing? — What action am I actually engaged in?
3. What am I feeling? — What sensations are present in my body right now?

These three bring you immediately into presence.

Then it goes deeper:

- What's happening? — Am I in a conversation? A commute?
- What am I noticing? — What is my attention drawn to?
- What am I sensing or picking up on? — Beyond the obvious — what's the vibe?
- What am I intuiting? — What is the intuitive message about this situation?

At work, this is productivity gold. If you always know what task you're actually on, you waste far less time.

Key Takeaway:

Start with three questions: What am I thinking? Doing? Feeling? This is the foundation of awareness.
