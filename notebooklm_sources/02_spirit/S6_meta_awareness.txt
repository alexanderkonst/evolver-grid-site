Module S6: Meta-Awareness

Key Question: How do I become aware of my awareness itself?

Script:

Meta-awareness is being aware of the changes in your consciousness.

Go to a spa. Get a Thai massage. Notice the before and after.

Go for a mountain hike. Notice how you feel at the bottom versus the top.

Enter a meeting with stressed colleagues. Notice how your state shifts.

Our bits per second of perception, our sensing — these change continuously depending on:
- Where we are
- Who we're with
- What we're doing

Meta-awareness is noticing these shifts as they happen.

Once you see it, you can design your life for higher states.

Key Takeaway:

Meta-awareness is noticing how your consciousness shifts depending on place, people, and activity. Once you see it, you can design for it.
