Module S3: Noticing Quality

Key Question: What else can I notice to grow my awareness?

Script:

Everything has a quality. Another word for it is vibration.

You're in a cafe. What's the quality of their food? Their menu design? Their furniture? Their service?

You're in a conversation. What's the quality of this person's presence? Their attention? Their words?

Noticing quality in things — objects, events, people, music, anything — is a very powerful key to becoming more aware.

This is not about judging "good" or "bad." It's about perceiving more information. It's about increasing your bits per second of perception.

When you start noticing quality everywhere, something shifts. Life becomes richer. Ordinary moments become extraordinary.

Key Takeaway:

Noticing quality in everything — objects, events, people — increases your awareness and enriches life.
