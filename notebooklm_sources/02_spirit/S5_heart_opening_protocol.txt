Module S5: Heart Opening Protocol

Key Question: What's the full heart opening protocol?

Script:

Heart opening is increasing our ability to sense — to feel more of what's happening around us and within us.

Here is a protocol that works for continuous heart opening:

1. Am I feeling anything right now? — Or is it blank? Just notice.

2. How intense is the feeling? — On a scale. In an argument? Intense. Just sitting? Less.

3. Where am I feeling it in the body? — Feelings are felt somewhere. Locate it.

4. What am I feeling? — Can you put a word to it? Is it familiar?

5. How long can I stay with the feeling? — Don't rush to move on.

6. Am I allowing myself to fully feel it, or am I escaping? — Be honest.

7. Is the feeling changing as I stay with it? — Usually it does.

8. What information is this feeling delivering to me? — Feelings carry messages.

To feel more, we must actually feel more. This protocol trains that.

Key Takeaway:

The 8-step heart opening protocol: Notice → Intensity → Location → Name → Stay → Allow → Watch change → Receive message.
