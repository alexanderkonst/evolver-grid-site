Module 1.8: Genius Path Defined

Key Question: What exactly is the Genius path? What grows, and how do I know I'm progressing?

Script:

GENIUS is our path of showing up in life — our path of authenticity and true self-expression. Where we go from wearing masks to more and more authenticity.

Metric: How well we can articulate who we are, what we do, who our ideal client is, and what we naturally do best — and how much we actually show up according to that.

High development: Better and better monetization of our talents. Life aligned with our true nature.

Key Takeaway:

The Genius path develops authentic self-expression — showing up as who we truly are.
