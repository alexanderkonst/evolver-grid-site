Module 1.6: Emotions Path Defined

Key Question: What exactly is the Emotions path? What grows, and how do I know I'm progressing?

Script:

EMOTIONS is what people also call shadow work or trauma healing — but really, it's about how we experience emotions, deal with them, and regulate across the entire spectrum of human feeling.

This is significant because if we numb uncomfortable emotions, we also numb pleasure, joy, and all desired emotions. There is just one slider to the intensity of felt experience.

As we grow on this path, we regulate ourselves better and experience more pleasant emotions more often.

Metric: How proficient we are at recognizing emotions and self-regulating — leading to higher agency and autonomy, staying centered in non-reactivity, and being able to choose our response.

High development: Invincibility in vulnerability. Cessation of needing to prove, pretend, or hide.

Key Takeaway:

The Emotions path develops self-regulation — our ability to process and choose our emotional responses.
