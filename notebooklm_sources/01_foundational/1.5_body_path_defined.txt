Module 1.5: Body Path Defined

Key Question: What exactly is the Body path? What grows, and how do I know I'm progressing?

Script:

BODY is your physical body — your health, your actions, your posture, and the vessel of experiencing freedom, sensuality, pleasure, and adventure.

As we develop along this path, our vitality increases. We feel better, accomplish more in a day, and become more vivacious and active.

Metric: Heart Rate Variability (HRV) is the one composite master metric that captures the state of the body in the moment. We'll explore this in later modules.

High development: Rarely being sick, high fitness, great posture, a relaxed strong body, and coherent breathing.

Key Takeaway:

The Body path develops vitality — the life energy available for living and creating.
