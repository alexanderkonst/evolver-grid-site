Module 1.7: Mind Path Defined

Key Question: What exactly is the Mind path? What grows, and how do I know I'm progressing?

Script:

MIND is all about how we think — the quality of our thinking and our worldview. Our mind is the perception lens through which we see life.

As we develop our thinking, we perceive the world more and more as it is, with increasing clarity. This leads to better decisions and allows us to see deeper meaning.

Metric: We will explore exactly which worldviews exist and how distortions in perception give place to clarity as thinking matures.

High development: Intuitive knowing. Deeper meaning in everything around.

Key Takeaway:

The Mind path develops clarity of perception — how accurately and deeply we see reality.
