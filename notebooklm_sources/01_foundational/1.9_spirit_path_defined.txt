Module 1.9: Spirit Path Defined

Key Question: What exactly is the Spirit path? What grows, and how do I know I'm progressing?

Script:

SPIRIT is most easily understood through its three key components: awareness, sensitivity, and character. These are "meta-abilities" — skills of all skills — because they are always in action when we live our life.

Awareness is what we notice in each moment. Think of it as bits per second of information we perceive. Deeper awareness reveals levels of depth and quality in whatever we look at — filling everyday experience with deeper meaning and joy of the present moment.

Sensitivity — often called "heart opening" in ancient traditions — is our ability to sense or feel. This is not to be confused with emotions, which are just one kind of sensation. Sensitivity can be compared to brightness or saturation of life experience.

Character is the ethical foundation — our integrity, groundedness, and responsibility. It's the "gut" component of spirit that allows us to stay true to our values even under pressure.

Key Takeaway:

The Spirit path develops awareness + sensitivity + character — the meta-abilities underlying all growth.
