Module B2: Body Foundations

Key Question: What are the key practices for developing the body?

Script:

The body develops through four main areas:

1. Movement — The body is designed to move. Sitting all day atrophies it. Exercise, walking, stretching, dancing — all count. Find movement you actually enjoy.

2. Breath — Most people breathe shallowly, through their mouth, into their chest. Proper breathing is: nose, belly, slow, coherent. We covered this in the Master Practice (S4).

3. Sleep — This is when repair happens. Quality matters more than quantity. Deep sleep and REM cycles are where the magic happens.

4. Nutrition — What you put in affects what you get out. But don't make it complicated. Eat real food. Mostly plants. Not too much.

Bonus: Cold — Cold exposure trains the nervous system, builds resilience, and increases metabolism. Even 30 seconds of cold water at the end of a shower counts.

The goal isn't perfection in all areas. It's consistent attention across all of them.

Key Takeaway:

Body develops through: Movement, Breath, Sleep, Nutrition (+Cold exposure). Consistent attention beats perfection.
