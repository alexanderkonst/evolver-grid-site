Module B3: Reading Your Body

Key Question: How do I know if my body is in healthy equilibrium?

Script:

Your body is constantly communicating with you. The question is whether you're listening.

Here are signals to pay attention to:

Energy levels — Do you wake up rested? Do you crash in the afternoon? Do you have energy for what matters?

Tension patterns — Where do you carry tension? Shoulders? Jaw? Stomach? These are stored stress.

Breath quality — Are you breathing through your nose? Is your belly expanding? Or are you chest-breathing, mouth-open, shallow?

Posture — Are you collapsed or open? Hunched or aligned? Posture reflects inner state and affects it.

Recovery speed — How quickly do you bounce back from illness, stress, exertion?

Pain signals — Is something hurting? Pain is information. Don't just mask it.

The practice is simple: check in regularly. Multiple times a day, pause and ask: How is my body right now? What's it telling me?

Over time, this builds body awareness — the ability to catch problems before they become crises.

Key Takeaway:

Read your body through: energy, tension, breath, posture, recovery, pain. Regular check-ins build awareness.
